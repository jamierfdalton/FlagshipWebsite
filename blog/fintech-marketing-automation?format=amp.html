<div class="amp-article-html-block"><p class=""><em>As the person responsible for the development of your business, you have to be on top of your game all the time; attracting leads, nurturing them through the funnel, handing over decent MQLs to your sales colleagues, closing deals, managing your firm’s reputation…the list is huge.</em></p>
<p class=""><em>Everywhere we look there are stories of the numbers that Business Developers need to reach but only a special few seem to maintain the pace whilst others fight a daily grind to keep their head above water. What is it that makes these golden business developers so efficient?</em></p>
<h3>Making time through automation</h3>
<p class="">Has it ever occurred to you that you these FinTech marketers and salespeople who appear to have more time than you, may actually be doing less than you might think?</p>
<p class="">Since the birth of the microchip, the key to human progress has been the delegation of repetitive tasks to machines and computers. This is the process that has helped us turn human-led production lines into manufacturing giga-factories capable of producing many thousands of times more product than a human-led production line.</p>
<p class="">Business development is no different. If we can reduce the labour-intensive but necessary areas of our job, we can spend more time focusing on areas that are both more interesting to us as humans and more important to us as people generating revenue for our businesses.</p>
<p class="">So how do we do this?</p>
<p class="">The first step on the quest for efficiency is automation. There are many areas where automation can really help, but here are just three to think about.</p>
<h3>1) Email outreach for sales</h3>
<p class="">If your CRM system has the capability to automate email sequences (and other tasks) that can be a great time-saver for marketers and salespeople.</p>
<p class="">The number of times I have worked with salespeople who spend hours crafting the perfectly-researched, optimised and eloquently written email, finally sending it only to throw all that work away and repeat the process makes me weep. CRM systems like HubSpot have email templating to allow you to write an email once and personalise it, sequences that combine emails and other tasks like phone calls so that you never physically write or send a series of emails until your prospect replies.</p>
<p class="">Even if you're not using a fully developed marketing automation tool you can create mail merges through a combo of Microsoft Word and Excel which will massively reduce the amount of time you spend crafting a new email. Now, this isn't to say that all your outreach should come from the same template.</p>
<p class="">We all know that different prospects have different needs and styles and different approaches are necessary for each. But, if you can identify categories for whom certain email snippets are applicable, you can reduce the amount of re-inventing the wheel significantly, with a small amount of preparation. Here, an hour spent on prep will save you 100s of hours on writing throughout a year.</p>
<h3>2) Lead notification</h3>
<p class="">As business developers, we all know that timing is key. Most, if not all salespeople will have set a deal to Closed Lost with the note that 'it's not the right time' for a particular contact to buy. How much time would you save if you only spoke to people for whom your product was timed correctly?</p>
<p class="">If you've integrated your website analytics and your CRM and activated the appropriate notification systems, you will be able to see exactly who has visited your site when. This is one of the most underused tools in the marketing and sales toolkit which is bizarre because if you know that there's a prospect currently looking at your pricing page for the 3rd time today, it's probably a good time to pick up the phone because this lead is red-hot!</p>
<p class="">In other cases, it might not be quite as clear that a user is interested in making a purchase decision, but if they're looking at information pages about what you do and how you do it, there's an opportunity to provide them with even more tailored information that can help turn a fact-finding mission into a decision.</p>
<h3>3) Analytics and Reporting on Web and Email</h3>
<p class="">Targeted reporting, showing exactly what is working and what is not, how people are behaving on your site and emails, understanding what they are doing with your content and figuring out if this is helping a prospect to move forward is a great help in improving efficiency.</p>
<p class="">Even better if the reports are sent to the right internal stakeholders automatically, so each person receives customised information on the leads or clients for which they are responsible, without having to look for the information because it has been sent directly to their inbox.</p>
<p class="">This is doubly important because it provides information to those people who can actually take action on it. Typically website analytics are owned by the marketing team and they can't spend all their time forwarding interesting reports to the sales dept. But don't you think your account management team might benefit from knowing that their best customer just clicked on the next tier of your product offering?</p>
<h3>Don’t be dominated by technology</h3>
<p class="">But maybe you’re saying, “We have all that and I’m still overwhelmed.” in a very good <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/productivity-tips-for-salespeople-to-streamline-your-day-slideshare?__hstc=114228120.c10722a8da0dd6ae8615e83059199467.1548164976540.1577969374081.1577971909645.120&amp;__hssc=114228120.9.1577971909645&amp;__hsfp=2240718579"><span>HubSpot ‘5 minute read’</span></a>, author Doug Davidoff talks about the overwhelming amount of technical resource that can stop salespeople functioning efficiently as they search for the right system, process or report to enable them to take the next step.</p>
<p class="">If you are actually having to work harder because of the technology that’s supposed to be helping you then you may need a system that is more integrated and configurable for different roles.</p>
<p class="">Some marketing automation systems are over-complex requiring the attention of a programming team to make them work. Others are too simple and require add-on systems to provide a solution.</p>
<p class="">Other times, in the quest for efficiency and FOMO, can induce analysis paralysis as your Business Development teams work to figure out how they can use different tools and services to get a marginal edge.</p>
<p class="">We are HubSpot partners because we believe that HubSpot has got it right, not only in the technology they provide but in the philosophy that underpins it – inbound – an approach that covers all interactions with clients – marketing, sales and service.</p>
<h3>Inbound marketing&nbsp;</h3>
<p class="">There are two sides to this problem – one is not managing processes efficiently - especially on the sales side. As we have seen, tech can both help and get in the way.</p>
<p class="">The other side is this: “Are you too busy because you are going after prospects rather than letting prospects come to you?”</p>
<p class="">There is no question that chasing cold prospects is a numbers game, and the numbers are huge. It’s the modern-day equivalent of the sales reps who made 100 visits to get 10 business cards to get 1 meeting, and after weeks of mind-numbing slog, they made a sale.</p>
<p class="">In the process, they were bumped off by hundreds of potential buyers who were just not interested. Only the most determined and resilient managed, and one or two of them found the techniques to succeed in this drab milieu and became very successful.</p>
<h3>Talk to people who are already interested</h3>
<p class="">Life has moved a very long way. The biggest paradigm shift is that buyers now have the internet and can research information before they buy.</p>
<blockquote>
 <p class="">__________________________________________________</p>
 <p class=""><em>&quot;47% of buyers viewed 3-5 pieces of content before engaging with a sales rep.&quot;</em> <em>Demand Gen Report, 2016 (Source: </em><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?__hstc=114228120.c10722a8da0dd6ae8615e83059199467.1548164976540.1577969374081.1577971909645.120&amp;__hssc=114228120.9.1577971909645&amp;__hsfp=2240718579"><span><em>https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics</em></span></a><em>)</em></p>
 <p class=""><em>_________________________________________________</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="">That means that if you can get the right content in front of prospects at the right time, prospects will engage with you because they are already interested.</p>
<p class="">That’s so much easier than being rebuffed by hundreds of people who just don’t care. This is where marketers can really help.</p>
<p class=""><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<h3>Knowledge is king:</h3>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
 <li><p class="">Research your customers and understand their pain-points</p></li>
 <li><p class="">Recognise that they will research their problems as well as their solutions online</p></li>
 <li><p class="">Know the journey your prospects are on from understanding their problem to deciding how to get to the right type of solution, to choosing a provider.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Use the 4 Bees:</h3>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
 <li><p class="">BE HELPFUL. Provide what your prospect needs at every stage of their journey – whether it’s education, tools, templates, contacts…</p></li>
 <li><p class="">Be honest – if you can’t help then still be helpful by suggesting alternative options</p></li>
 <li><p class="">Be discoverable – learn how your prospects use the internet so they can find your help. Write plenty of relevant, helpful content – use blogs, videos, graphics – whatever is easiest for your prospect to consume</p></li>
 <li><p class="">Be relevant – make sure your content actually provides the answers they have been searching for.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Help them engage:</h3>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
 <li><p class="">Use carefully crafted offers and CTAs to invite them to your site</p></li>
 <li><p class="">Build special landing pages – at least one per offer – maybe one per region or sales rep</p></li>
 <li><p class="">Make sign up forms that are sufficient but not intrusive</p></li>
 <li><p class="">Follow up quickly – don’t leave them hanging</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Look after you</h3>
<p class="">This is absolutely common sense, but we all are guilty of forgetting ourselves when the pressure is on.</p>
<p class="">You are the go-to person for business development in your firm. That means people are relying on you, keeping you under pressure to deliver for the sale of everyone in the business.</p>
<p class="">So, as well as automating your activities in a smart way, and confining your outreach only to those who are already interested in your company’s products and services, you personally need to remain on top form too.</p>
