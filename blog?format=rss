Simply that it’s the unique promise or value you provide to your clients and prospects. Here are some characteristics of a well-formulated value proposition:</p><h3>Emotionally Based</h3><p class="">At the <a href="https://theidm.com/" target="_blank"><span>Institute of Data and Marketing</span></a><span>,</span> we were taught that a value proposition is, “the single-minded expression of an emotional or physical benefit”.</p><p class="">I don’t know where the quote comes from, but it captures one important element which is the emotional connection that a good value proposition should have, but there are others.</p><h3>Research-based</h3><p class="">Your value proposition is based on your understanding of your target clients. Knowing them as you do, what are you offering them?</p><p class="">How does your offer create gains for them?</p><p class="">How does your offer relieve their pain?</p><p class="">Work out what is essential in your offer, rather than what is just nice to have, based on your understanding of your clients’ needs and wants. Now go back to your competitor analysis and see what they are doing and what you can do differently. This is your value to the market.</p><p class="">You need one value proposition for each of your target groups, but they should be linked closely together because they are all based, one way or another, on your offer.</p><h3>Online and offline</h3><p class="">Dr Dave Chaffey, CEO of <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/" target="_blank">Smart Insights </a>reminds us that we operate in both a physical and a digital world, and the digital world offers some advantages over the physical – in particular, it gives us access to a much wider population, whether it’s suppliers or clients than is easily possible in the physical world. It also allows you to go to places that are not possible in the physical world, such as close up to the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, or to a tea garden in Kyoto.</p><p class="">Dr Chaffey writes, “ideally the online value proposition should exploit some of the unique advantages of being online which include immediacy, interactivity and depth of content, faster, more convenient, easier as well as cheaper to buy online, better experience online, new experiences online, more resources or information online…”</p><h3>A great tool to help you</h3><p class="">The <a href="https://www.strategyzer.com/canvas/value-proposition-canvas" target=""><span>value proposition canvas</span></a> is a marketing classic, developed by business consultants, Strategyzer. It’s actually a simple way to get you to ask the right questions and to visualise the final proposition. One of its key strengths is that it gives us a way for a group of people, rather than an individual, to work on the value proposition or to review it.</p><p class="">It is vitally important that the value proposition is not the work of one person, and then imposed on the organisation, but is co-created by a group of stakeholders firstly to focus it sharply, and secondly to foster adoption across the organisation.</p><h3>How we built our value proposition</h3><p class="">We think the best way to explain a concept is to show you, and so we’d like to tell you exactly what we did with our own value proposition and hopefully you’ll find it helpful.</p><h3>First: we researched and identified our target market</h3><p class="">Our primary target market is the FinTech sector challenging the incumbent financial players with disruptive peer to peer technologies or supporting it through RegTech, InsurTech and other financial technology companies.</p><p class="">Although blockchain was taking the headlines at the point where we were analysing this, we identified 4 main areas of focus (and investment):</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Blockchain</p></li><li><p class="">Robotics and process automation (such as the rise of robo-advisors for wealth management)</p></li><li><p class="">Biometrics and identity management</p></li><li><p class="">AI</p></li></ol><p class="">Cybersecurity and GDPR compliance are specific areas of focus which may sometimes involve the use of FinTech technologies and has certainly given rise to new tech start-ups which we would consider to be part of our market if they operate within the financial services industry.</p><p class="">We also know that brand-new start-ups are not our target market. The kind of product we offer requires a commitment to ongoing marketing activity, and it requires both budget and data to be successful. Our target market is usually firms that are further into their journey than brand new start-ups.</p><h3>Qualifying in (and out) best-fit prospects</h3><p class="">We are very niche and focused in our target market, arguably we may be too tight, but we are confident that we can add value in our target market space, because of our previous experiences and expertise.</p><p class="">To help you determine what is the best-fit prospect type for your business, we have created a B2B prospect fit evaluation workbook. It’s essential to apply these principles when you are nurturing leads at the decision stage of the buyer journey, (see our <a href="https://flagshipmarketing.com/blog/converting-leads">blog on converting leads </a>to learn more about this) but you can equally well use it to help define your target market before you even start promoting your products and services.</p><h3>Research your market</h3><p class="">It’s very important to have a firm grasp on the situation in which your target market operates. Clearly, the FinTech market represents a paradigm shift from the pre-2008 (Lehman et al) position, where challenger banks, peer-to-peer platforms and crypto-currency offerings proliferate.</p><p class="">Our research revealed a number of things:</p><h3>Challenge vs collaborate</h3><p class="">Initially, FinTechs grew out of the global financial crisis of 2008, and so they had the aim of disrupting the banking and financial services industry. As time has passed many of these companies now see their best chance is to work with the incumbents for reasons of regulation, investment and other support.</p><p class="">Banks have also embraced the so-called FinTech revolution by building accelerators or by investing directly in these new companies. It allows them to control the threat and modulate the approach of the disruptors. The FinTech companies get investment and other support they need to deliver their technology (which the bank will own at least in part).</p><blockquote><p class=""><em>Application: This is important for us because it means we can’t look at the FinTech target market as a stand-alone proposition. Incumbents are there too.</em></p></blockquote><h3>There are delivery and culture problems</h3><p class="">Although they are no longer inimical to the very idea of each other, our research revealed there is an issue of culture which can cause significant strain – especially that of the nimble start-up versus the monolithic and bureaucratic enterprise, and delays to delivering products that the bank considers fit for purpose.</p><p class="">Developing technology is capital intensive, and the cultural problems and longer than expected lead times haven’t helped. The ROI that both parties have hoped for is taking longer to generate. In 2017 when we did this analysis, only 20% of financial services companies expected ROI on their investments in FinTech products.</p><p class="">We then felt that there was (and is) a growing pressure to deliver not only a product but a profit, which if not met may mean banks will be reluctant to take on new FinTech companies as ‘too difficult’.</p><blockquote><p class=""><em>Application: This helped us to see that despite the fact that FinTech firms had secured funding and a safe haven in the banks, the need to build a solid pipeline of clients was still a priority. Those that have gone with other investors are even more under pressure as those investors look for lucrative exits.</em> <em>Looking at this through an industry lens, we felt a failure to address this problem could lead to another shift in the entire FinTech industry as bank find the investment ‘too difficult’ whilst at the same time acquiring the skills and staff to innovate on their own.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Regulation</h3><p class="">We were also becomingly increasingly aware of the issues posed by regulation. When we started our analysis, many FinTech firms were operating in ways that meant they had no direct regulatory oversight, but we sensed it was only a matter of time before the regulators started to scrutinise FinTech activity, and so it proved.</p><p class="">The argument we made a few years ago when I was CMO at Euroclear, was that technology is not regulated in the financial markets (it may be different in medicine or defence!) but activities are. One activity that has caught the eye of the regulators is the issue of tokens and coins (ICOs, ITOs) to raise funds.</p><p class="">Those FinTechs that do this argue compellingly that it broadens and democratises the market, allowing the ordinary person to have a stake in building a new business, which in the old world would be accessible mainly to institutional investors and their high net worth clients. The regulators argue compellingly that there needs to be some protection for investors and have begun to characterise certain types of tokens and coins as securities that fall under security issuance regulations.</p><blockquote><p class=""><em>Application: The regulatory agenda is one we will have to watch constantly as it may have a very significant impact on the FinTech market. Banks, not FinTechs, are the masters of working within a regulated industry.</em></p></blockquote><h3>What is our target market trying to achieve?</h3><p class="">This is a vital piece of analysis that stops your research simply being a map of your target market landscape at a single point in time. (Although it should be a living document, it will actually reflect the situation at any given time.)</p><p class="">Given what we had uncovered about the pressure FinTechs are under to speed up the delivery of a solid ROI, we were able to create a priority list for what we understood they needed to do to meet the goal of fast ROI.</p><p class="">Our list of top ten FinTech priorities looked like this:</p><p class=""><strong>FinTechs need to:</strong></p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Establish their business case</p></li><li><p class="">Attract investment</p></li><li><p class="">Acquire talent</p></li><li><p class="">Develop their product or service</p></li><li><p class="">Build awareness *</p></li><li><p class="">Develop interest *</p></li><li><p class="">Generate (more) leads *</p></li><li><p class="">Improve the quality of leads and conversion to sales ratio *</p></li><li><p class="">Understand and comply with the regulatory implications</p></li><li><p class="">Eventually, manage (delight) existing clients *</p></li></ol><blockquote><p class=""><em>Application: The points with an asterisk are those where our own products and services could help. In other words, we were beginning to see the fit between our own company and our target market, and also the other priorities that FinTech companies have which might take the focus away from our offering.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Is the FinTech ROI uplift a problem that should be solved?</h3><p class="">Everyone who has been involved in any commercial venture knows that inertia is often the biggest hurdle to making a deal. If the costs and hassle of taking on a new service are not matched by the pain and pressure of the problem, people won’t bite – especially if there is a perceived risk or accountability in the purchase.</p><p class="">One statistic we have quoted before is from the CB Insights study, “Top 20 reasons why start-ups fail”, and the number one reason is that they build a product nobody wants. It may be better to say, ‘nobody wants the product enough to overcome the inertia factor’.</p><p class="">We too could be in that position, so we took a great deal of care to answer this in the best way we could, with the knowledge we had after our research.</p><p class="">We looked at this in several different ways:</p><h3>Could the problem lead to a significant failure in the FinTech industry?</h3><h4>What did it mean for banks?</h4><p class="">At the point where we did the research, the banks were very worried about losing revenue to the innovation community. Key sectors were payments, fund transfers and personal finance.</p><p class="">In a 2017 FinTech survey by PwC, more 88% of incumbents believed that their business is at risk from disruptors. That means the imperative for the banks to control the innovation agenda is very high.</p><p class="">82% of incumbents expected to partner with FinTech in 2017 and 77% were increasing internal efforts to innovate.</p><p class="">For the banks then, cracking the FinTech problem was a high priority. Whilst no one thought the banks would be displaced, failure to manage the innovation threat or embrace the opportunity would have created a loss of revenue and increased costs.</p><p class="">At the point of our research in 2017, it was clear that banks feared them, were willing to work with them, but also looking at going it alone if they had to. We felt there was an opportunity for FinTechs to deliver for the banks, and if they didn’t the banks would discard them.</p><p class="">Undoubtedly the two biggest challenges for FinTechs were attracting investment and managing regulation. To both, the banks provided a solution, but we felt that this would be to a limited number of companies. Many FinTech companies would have to work outside the banking environment; delivering their products quickly and generating a return on investment as soon as possible. For these firms, failure to do so is an existential threat.</p><blockquote><p class=""><em>Application: Although we could not help in the regulation and investment areas which were priorities for this emerging breed of new companies, we could help in the delivering of ROI. Those in the banking circle would have pressure, but also access to the banks’ own marketing resources. Those outside, would need firms like us.</em></p></blockquote><h4>Is there any industry support to address these issues?</h4><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">There is global support (from social and regulatory organisations) for a challenge to the banking industry and FinTech is an effective way of challenging the incumbents.</p></li><li><p class="">ROI is slow, but the economy is picking up which increases the opportunities</p></li><li><p class="">Failure to develop ROI means that the status quo will not be challenged and the FinTech organisations themselves will fail.</p></li><li><p class="">Increased competition (bubble) makes it imperative for FinTech organisations to take business development seriously.</p></li></ul><p class="">Regulators will at some point want to regulate, not the products, but the way the products are used, and FinTech companies will have to take on board the regulatory aspects of their market.</p><h3>Fixing these problems is important if a large number of FinTechs are to survive.</h3><h4>Is the problem something that needs to be addressed now or later...or maybe sometime?</h4><p class="">Clearly, the answer is 'now' for those FinTech companies under pressure to pay back investors and generate a revenue stream. Those under the auspices of large banks and financial firms may have a little more time.</p><h4>What is the competition like?</h4><p class=""> Looking at the competition is really important; another reason for companies to fail is that they enter a market where competition is simply too fierce for them to penetrate and make a difference, even if their products are better and cheaper: if they can’t be heard over the tumult in the marketplace, they have little chance.</p><p class="">There are solution providers in the space – this is a competitive field, but with the extensive financial industry, FinTech and tech start-up experience coupled with trained marketing skills, we have many advantages.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p class="">The problem is obvious (to the industry) and is closer to critical than aspirational. At some levels it represents a real threat to many of the FinTech companies as well as to the goal of challenging the incumbent banking sector to raise its game.</p><blockquote><p class=""><em>Application: The bottom line is that resolving the problem is not optional (aspirational) nor is it unacknowledged (latent) which would be a much harder sell.</em></p></blockquote><h3>Segmentation</h3><p class="">Although we are taking a linear route through one generic FinTech Marketing Agency value proposition, ideally you would need one value proposition for each of your target segments. To do that here would turn this long article into War and Peace, but I have included below the template we used to segment the FinTech market.</p><h3>How granular should you go?</h3><p class="">There are two key points to remember when you are segmenting your market.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">The first is that segments should have common characteristics, so you should be able to say what shared characteristics, (needs, demographics etc) are present in your segment.</p></li><li><p class="">The second is that different segments should have different marketing needs – or why bother to segment. In the end, we did not use every box on the spreadsheet to segment our target market but having a guide like this helped us to easily visualise what the segment possibilities looked like.</p></li></ul><p class="">The answer to, “How granular should I go?” is only to the point where you have groups with enough shared internal qualities to share the same marketing needs, which are different needs to the other groups you can see in your target market.</p><h3>Examining ourselves</h3><p class="">So, we have looked at our target market, and we now need to look at ourselves and what we can offer as honestly and objectively as we can.</p><p class="">There are many guides as to how to do this; we used a little book called God is my CEO which offers a particular Christian perspective, which is very relevant to our own faith values, and you may want to use the same or have other resources that you prefer.</p><p class="">In the end, we looked at our values, our skills, our experience, our passion, and asked the question, “If money was no object, what would I do?”</p><h3>What we came up with for Flagship Marketing</h3><p class=""><strong>We specialise in building business for FinTech firms which have the following characteristics:</strong></p><p class=""><strong>Demographic</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Attached to a bank</p></li><li><p class="">Not attached to a bank</p></li><li><p class="">Anglophone or Francophone</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Psychographic – who are worried about</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Lack of ROI</p></li><li><p class="">Job security</p></li><li><p class="">Challenging the banks (social)</p></li><li><p class="">Getting their product to market</p></li><li><p class="">And the regulatory aspects of their industry</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Our product/service is helping FinTechs</strong></p><p class="">Note that we didn’t talk about our product in terms of ‘how’ but in terms of outcomes. We are not copywriters or media buyers, because that doesn’t meet the needs of our target market. Instead, we said our goal is to help FinTech firms:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Become well-known (discoverability) in the noisy marketplace) and helping their targets to understand why they are a good answer to their problems</p></li><li><p class="">Understand their target market and how to sell into it profitably</p></li><li><p class="">Attract high-quality leads</p></li><li><p class="">Convert leads to sales</p></li><li><p class="">Retain and increase engagement with customer base (delighting for retention and advocacy and referrals)</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>We are specialists who understand three things especially well.</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Global financial services market</p></li><li><p class="">Tech start-ups</p></li><li><p class="">Content marketing, digital marketing/business development</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>That provides the ability to</strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Position FinTech products successfully in a competitive landscape</p></li><li><p class="">Effectively address FinTech target markets – with issues that are relevant to them, at the point where they consume information, as trusted people known in the industry</p></li><li><p class="">Position the FinTech organisation as credible and relevant and create awareness around it</p></li><li><p class="">Generate a pipeline of highly qualified (i.e. high quality) business leads</p></li><li><p class="">Lead prospects through a funnel from awareness to commitment</p></li><li><p class="">Build engagement with existing customers to help retention and advocacy to support new sales, and, if appropriate cross or upsell products to boost ROI</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Unlike general marketing agencies</strong></p><p class="">We have skills and experience in a particular domain which means that we are not ‘going to school’ on our customer’s time, we know their industry because for years it has been our industry too.</p><p class="">And we offer something on top of that which is our industry perspective and expertise. Because we are an agency, we see far more FinTech companies than any of our customers do, and we can offer them a deep and broad perspective on the industry which they would find difficult from their singular point of view.</p><h3>Our Value Proposition</h3><p class="">So we come to our value proposition. There’s one more thing to say about it; A value proposition should be compelling to those we want to attract <span>and repelling to those we can’t serve</span>. In other words, it needs to help qualify prospects.</p><p class="">That requires a radical focus on relevance all the time. It should work at a macro level for sites etc, and at a micro-level of individual customers. The end game is to talk about our value, not just in a polite way, but that compels people to act.</p><p class="">Here’s where we have got to today. It’s not finished – it never will be - but it’s a start that shows the value we bring, the uniqueness of our offer, for a specific group of clients (although we can be more granular) and importantly, why we are doing it.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">We believe the socially-motivated, fresh-thinking FinTech movement has the potential to make the financial industry better for everyone</p></li><li><p class="">Flagship Marketing is a specialist digital and content marketing agency focused on building profitable ROI over time for FinTech scale-ups which are committed to overcoming the potentially existential risks of bringing a new product to market</p></li><li><p class="">We do this through more than 30 years of study and practice in financial services, digital and content marketing and through the insights of managing our own start-up firms from the 1980s till today.</p></li></ol>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f983681a3b29f646dbd85fe/1604316316452-PJL1EEIGXJAEKXH2RGNE/anne-nygard-SM8XB01NGjQ-unsplash.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1001"><media:title type="plain">Creating a value proposition – our story</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Converting Leads</title><category>CRO</category><category>Fintech</category><category>Lead Generation</category><dc:creator>Jamie Dalton</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 11:25:49 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/blog/converting-leads</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f983681a3b29f646dbd85fe:5f994a83a7b60175a5a43ffd:5f9bf79d1f89434da294b271</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">We are drowning in prose. And videos. Infographics. GIFs. Top companies are blogging once a day or more. Nobody can cope with the volume and with the noise, so what’s going on? Is it possible to compete in the cacophony - in short, does all this noise produce results?</p><h3>Does it all work?</h3><p class="">Well, according to <a href="https://www.zazzlemedia.co.uk/blog/state-of-content-marketing-2019/#gref"><span>the State of Content Marketing Survey</span></a> published by Zazzle Media, marketers think all this noise is working very well, thank you. The definition of a good marketing survey is that it makes you think and challenges you with new insights, and the Zazzle survey does that.</p><p class="">Zazzle talked to “thousands of marketing decision-makers” to get these results, and so it is hardly surprising that we’re bombarded by content. It doesn’t seem to matter – content is working for a very large number of organisations.47% think that their content marketing is very effective. Not bad! 31% think it is somewhat effective. OK. And 19% think it is extremely effective. That’s really very good. If you add together all the respondents to this survey who think their content marketing is effective it comes to a whopping 96%.</p><h3>What does ‘work’ mean?</h3><p class="">It’s all very well to say that content marketing is working well for so many people, but what does that really mean?</p><p class="">And here’s the piece in this intriguing survey I found really interesting. How do the respondents measure success?</p><p class="">Only 51% want their marketing to increase sales, whilst more than 80% want to increase website traffic. The website numbers are a vital part of the process – the more people you can talk to the more people you can ultimately convert to customers, that’s what content marketing is, but generating website traffic is relatively easy – especially at the top of funnel. The harder thing is to nurture those contacts, developing trust along the way until you can hand them over as marketing qualified leads at the end. That’s when marketing has done its job and the sales teams can take those leads and convert them into customers.</p><h3>Metrics that hurt</h3><p class="">If only 51% of thousands of marketing decision-makers want to increase sales and are prepared to be accountable for those number, a lot of sales teams are going to be missing out on a steady flow of marketing qualified leads. It is they who will spend their time prospecting and lead nurturing instead of the marketing teams.</p><p class="">It speaks volumes to the problems sales and marketing teams have with each other, why they think marketers are only good for brochureware and events, and it raises the question, “What do the other half hope to achieve if only 51% are looking to increase their conversion rates through content marketing?”</p><p class="">Remember, this is an activity that 96% of respondents say is an effective strategy for their business. It is therefore not surprising that 73% of executives do not believe that marketing drives demand and revenue.</p><p class="">We’ve <a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/s/7-Metrics-that-show-the-value-of-your-marketing.pdf">written about this</a> before and the reason we emphasise it so much is because it is the foundation of the marketing team’s reputation. As long as marketers insist on being accountable just for the process rather than the outcomes, CEOs will be justifiably sceptical about the value of marketing and marketers.</p><p class="">Goals for marketing campaigns</p><p class="">The issue becomes even more interesting in <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/3476323/State%20of%20Inbound%202018%20Global%20Results.pdf"><span>HubSpot’s State of Inbound Survey, 2018.</span></a> In the latest version of this annual survey, HubSpot asked respondents to list the priorities from their marketing campaigns. The top answer (with 69%) was to increase the number of conversions from contacts or leads into customers.</p><p class="">In response, HubSpot comments that BoFU (bottom of funnel) content is critical. This the place in the buyer journey where they are ready to make a decision about what to buy to solve their problem.</p><p class="">And there we have it. We want to increase conversions, to improve ROI and to contribute to real business goals, but many of us are measuring and reporting the first steps in the process, not the much more difficult bottom of funnel metrics.</p><h3>So, what now?</h3><p class="">Now, we need to develop strategies that address contacts at the bottom of funnel, but first we need to understand how the buyer journey works and what we mean by bottom of funnel.</p><p class="">Against this paradigm, HubSpot describes 3 stages in the buyer journey (see graphic). The awareness stage, the consideration stage and the decision stage. The decision stage is the only stage where you can measure an increase in sales. It’s what is happening at this stage that the CEO and those others responsible for the health of your business want to know about. The buyer journey has changed with the advent of search engines. Today buyers can research their own solutions without going to suppliers at all. That means buyers have more power than before. They have more choice because they are not limited by physical location and they have access to client opinion so do not need to talk to a salesperson until they are ready to purchase.</p><p class="">That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be concerned if website traffic is low; if you have no pipeline; if prospects are not responding to you even at the awareness stage. That’s a fundamental signal that something might be very wrong with the business and should be flagged quickly.</p><p class="">Here we are talking about when marketers focus only on the top of funnel numbers because those are easy to hit and only 51% dare to be accountable for the decision stage. That’s a problem about purpose, courage and maybe skills that will cause marketing to become discounted and overlooked in the minds of the C suite.</p><h3>Nurturing your leads</h3><p class="">If a prospect has understood his or her problem and has researched the various approaches that might help, and has opted for one of those strategies, then he is at the bottom of the sales funnel or at stage three of the buyer journey.</p><blockquote><p class="">However, we need to take a step back and look at our prospects at the consideration phase, because this is where we start to position ourselves in preparation for the bottom of funnel activities.</p></blockquote><p class="">The consideration stage or 'Middle of Funnel' is the most complex stage because of the variety of leads in the mix, who have expressed an interest in your company, but haven’t yet been qualified.</p><p class="">A person moves from top of funnel to middle of funnel (or awareness to consideration) at the moment they do something to show engagement with your product or services, but they are far from ready to buy. Look at our own case study.</p><h3>Watch out for people who don’t follow your conversion path</h3><p class="">At this point, it is worth saying a word about people who don’t follow the path you have mapped out for them. It can happen, and you need to be alert to capture the opportunity.</p><p class="">To that point, I have just in the last two minutes received a phone call from a very organised marketing department who are promoting webinar services. Yesterday I downloaded an eBook on webinar ideas from a company who didn’t know it, but we are actually in the market for a new webinar platform.</p><p class="">We’ve used a lot of platforms in the past ranging from small DIY apps to enterprise-level ecosystems, so we were not novices, but we might have appeared to be so because we downloaded a simple top-of-funnel eBook on how to conduct webinars.</p><p class="">Fortunately, the company phoned me, understood quickly that I was not a top of funnel prospect and moved me quickly to the bottom of funnel with the offer of a demo and a discount. I may not buy from them, but I am impressed with their savvy, and if I do, I’ll let everyone know.</p><h3>Our own case-study</h3><p class="">We have recently run an ad campaign on LinkedIn designed to bring people in at top of funnel and love them to the middle of funnel. We have assumed that they have a problem and they are looking to understand that problem better.</p><p class="">In order to attract them, we have offered them a selection of practical educational content and a series of workbooks to put their education into practice. In fact, the educational content alone may have been enough for the true top of funnel prospects – including the practical workbooks allows the prospects to explore a solution set, which means they are already looking at middle of funnel.</p><p class="">Both the prospects that wanted the educational pieces and those that wanted the workbooks have now shown an interest in us, but we don’t know where they are on the journey and what their intentions are.</p><p class="">So the next step is for us to ask them what they thought of our content and invite them to tell us something about its value to them. It’s a low commitment for them, but one that is extremely useful for us in beginning to separate this group into different levels of interest.</p><h3>Middle of Funnel approach</h3><p class="">We work on the basis that there are three characteristics common to all Middle of Funnel prospects:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">They have shown an interest in your product service or company by taking an action</p></li><li><p class="">They have left you with the means to contact them and permission to do so. (This may not always be true, but it is the most useful working model for this group.)</p></li><li><p class="">They are exploring a range of options to a known problem, e.g. recruit an expert, outsource the problem, upskill existing staff, carry on as today.</p></li></ol><p class="">This final point is the key because although they are not ready to buy, they are ready to understand more about your services and for you to position your company to them.</p><h3>Positioning your company for Middle of Funnel Prospects</h3><p class="">The key thing that sets you apart from everyone else is your value proposition. The subject is worth a blog and several workshops in its own right, so for now, let me share our value proposition and talk a bit about the principles behind it.</p><h3>Our own value proposition</h3><blockquote><p class="">We believe in FinTech firms are making the financial industry better for everyone Flagship Marketing is a specialist digital and content marketing agency focused on building profitable returns for FinTech firms as they transform the financial services industry. We do this through more than 30 years of study and practice in financial services, digital and content marketing and through the insights of managing our own start-up firms from the 1980s till today.</p></blockquote><p class="">Very simply – what is the promise you hold out to your customers? Who are they? How do you distinguish yourself from others – even if your product or service is not really unique?</p><p class="">Make sure this is clearly on your website, in your literature and wherever your Middle of Funnel prospects are trying to find out a bit more about you.</p><h3>Put on your prospect’s head</h3><p class="">Yep, we could have said shoes or moccasins but everyone says that, and we want you to think like your buyer, not dress up like him or her.</p><p class="">So where is your prospect’s head, what are they thinking now?</p><p class="">They are considering alternative strategies to solve a problem. Our customers probably are facing problems like this.</p><blockquote><p class=""><em>We’ve got some investment, hired a team and we’ve been selling our killer</em> <strong><em>FinTech</em></strong> <em>app. But, although lots of people are engaging and liking what we do, we can’t get enough to bite. We could discount our prices, or offer a different deal, but we’re not sure what the best, most sustainable approach is.</em> Or <em>We’ve also built our product in a competitive space, and we just can’t get heard over the noise of the big boys, even though our product is cheaper and an all-round-better-deal for our target market. We could take on a agency to help generate leads, but I’m not sure – or we could hire more sales staff which is an option I like, or we could maybe partner with someone bigger to get the visibility we need. Not sure.</em> Or <em>We’re just swamped, we’re a small team and we’re having to choose between serving our existing clients who are very demanding or prospecting for more. We’ve tried to keep the team lean as we’re not comfortable with taking on more fixed costs at this stage, but we may have to recruit if we can’t find another way. Maybe some tech could help but I’m no expert.</em></p></blockquote><p class="">These are the kinds of issues your prospects are facing at the middle of funnel stage. They’re very uncomfortable because they are in an undecided place, facing dilemmas that seem to have no solutions or too many possible solutions, and nothing is really clear for them yet.</p><h3>Now give them some answers.</h3><p class="">PS the answer is you, but you can’t be that direct yet.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Your prospect is looking for guidance, so offer him…guidebooks. At this stage, your prospect is in serious research mode so rich content that can explain how you and others would approach the problem. Don’t push towards a sale, but educate and help your prospect towards an answer to the question, what approach am I going to take?</p></li><li><p class="">Comparisons – here’s a bold one, but it is exactly what your prospect needs at this stage. Look at the possible routes your prospect may take – recruitment, employing an agency, buying some technology, and compare the options to showcase your strengths.</p></li><li><p class="">A really powerful option here is case studies. If you have great case studies of your won, that’s really great, but even if you don’t you can often find industry case studies that speak to the same point. Anyone who can say, “I was suffering the same conundrum as you are, Mr. Prospect, and I tried this and it worked superbly for me, (or, I tried something else, or everything else but the problem just got worse until I tried your solution). That sort of testimonial is so compelling especially if backed up by statistics and other proof points.</p></li></ul><h3>Get Personal</h3><p class="">Remember, the great advantage you have over top of funnel prospectors is that you know this person. They’ve given you their name, hopefully, their email address and permission to get in touch. At this point you’re not intruding; you’re helping them in their research.</p><p class="">Remember at the beginning of this blog we talked about drowning in prose and so on? If you use the invitation you have been given – to be in touch by email or even by phone, you cut away a huge amount of that noise, and you can have a more focused conversation away from the tumult of the web.</p><p class="">As long as you remain personal and helpful your communications should normally be welcome. However, that will quickly change as you try to move too quickly to a ‘pushy’ sales approach before your prospect is ready. However, all the tile you are in this lead nurturing phase you are building credibility, authority and trust in the mind of your buyer.</p><h3>Bottom of Funnel Prospects</h3><p class="">And so finally we have arrived at the place we wanted to be – the bottom of funnel. It has taken a long time, but we have built a reputation along the way as a careful, nurturing organisation, with broad and deep knowledge and a willingness to be helpful and supportive. That’s why the complex and sometimes long middle of funnel phase is so important and why it is worth spending the time to master it.</p><h3>How do we know when a prospect has moved from middle of funnel to bottom of funnel?</h3><p class="">This is not easy, and your prospect is probably not going to tell you “oops! I’ve just slipped from the middle to the bottom of your funnel”, so you have to judge it. They might, of course, give you a strong buying signal – asking about the best price or something similar, but many won’t.</p><p class="">If you have been helpful to your customer, taken the time to educate, guide, anticipate and answer questions, all the time positioning your own solution in the best possible light, you should not wait.</p><h3>So, now what do we do?</h3><p class="">There is still more for the markets to do, more information to give to get your prospect over the line.</p><h3>Qualify your lead</h3><p class="">One of the most important things to do is to decide if this lead is a good fit for your organisation. It’s late in the day, I know, but you can really only do this when you get to know them better, so it is possible to take this step when you are still in the middle of funnel phase, but here is the last chance.</p><p class="">We’ve written about this and provided a <a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/s/B2B-Prospect-Fit-Evaluation-Worksheet.xlsx">prospect evaluation worksheet</a> to look at your leads and start to qualify them.</p><p class="">We invite you to look at how good a fit your product is for their problem; whether they are big enough to buy the level of service you are offering, and whether you are big enough to meet their needs.</p><p class="">There is nothing worse than having an unhappy customer who might ruin your reputation, and where you can put a serious hole in his business plans, so don’t skip this step, it is very important.</p><h3>BoFU content</h3><p class="">Do you still need to provide content at this stage? Well, you need to provide something, but not the same educational content that you prepared earlier in the client journey.</p><p class="">Remember the prospect doesn’t need to speak to you right until the last minute – if at all. I can create a book an ad campaign on LinkedIn that may cost thousands of pounds or dollars, and I can do the whole thing without speaking to anyone at all.</p><p class="">How does LinkedIn tempt me in, and how does it convince me that I’m better with them than with Facebook (bigger and cheaper) Instagram, YouTube, Google Ads, Twitter and so on?</p><p class="">It’s not by sending a salesperson to my business or my home. It’s by creating the content that convinces me they have a special niche in the social media ecosystem, and that my needs are best served by the type of people who have LinkedIn accounts.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Case studies still work well here to distinguish you from the others, and those sites that have galleries of client reviews are compelling</p></li><li><p class="">Offers become very important now</p></li><li><p class="">free trial</p></li><li><p class="">special invitation to an event, webinar,</p></li><li><p class="">advance access to thought leadership</p></li><li><p class="">membership or a personalised logon to an information portal</p></li><li><p class="">free audit</p></li><li><p class="">live demonstration</p></li><li><p class="">Continuing engagement with helpful guides by email</p></li></ul><h3>MQL, SQL, SLA…?</h3><p class="">And the question is, once the prospect is engaging with all of this, when, if ever, do you hand him or her over to sales.</p><p class="">Largely this is up to your organisation, but the one non-negotiable is that there should be a Service Level Agreement between marketing and sales which defines what a marketing qualified lead is, and how it should be handed over to the sales team.</p><h3>Funnel Position</h3><p class="">Clearly, the position in the funnel will be important. Do you hand over leads when they reach the middle of funnel? For most companies that would be too early, but for somewhere the sales value is very high and a lot of customised handholding is needed, it may be that this is the ideal point.</p><h3>Qualification</h3><p class="">Qualification should normally be done before handover, so wherever you intend to do your handover, make sure that you have done your qualification of a good fit prospect, first.</p><h3>Lead Scoring</h3><p class="">We haven’t talked about lead scoring, but, especially if you are using a marketing automation tool like HubSpot, this is a very consistent way of determining when to handover a lead to sales.</p><p class="">Lead Scoring is not guesswork, but a data-driven activity. Look back over historical data to see what activities seem to be a trigger to closing. Even f you don’t have a lot of data, pick some standards and then test them over time.</p><p class="">The frequency of visits to your site – especially to a services or pricing page may be one factor to consider. And it doesn’t have to be a sale that you measure. You can score any goal – attendees to a webinar, subscription to a newsletter, responding to an article. As long as you can see patterns in how these engagement points came about you should be able at least to give a score to them and refine it as you get more data.</p><h3>Handover</h3><p class="">At the point where your lead has been qualified and reached a certain score, it is time to hand it over to the sales team – but this has to be done seamlessly and carefully or all the good work can be lost. All this should be documented in the form of an agreement – an SLA between sales and marketing.</p><p class="">The SLA should reflect the process and the responsibility of both teams. It is no good if marketing provides incomplete information or leads that really have not been thoroughly qualified. At the same time, it is entirely hopeless if sales ignore the leads and don’t follow up in the way that was expected.</p><p class="">There are many marketing and sales SLA templates available and we will be producing our own in the next few days t help you do this.</p><h3>Reporting</h3><p class="">Now there is no need to report the top of funnel numbers to your C-suite or to your sales colleagues. Instead, you can provide metrics they care about. We have identified 7 key metrics that will bolster marketing reputations and really show where you are making the difference.</p><h3>A Word on Funnels</h3><p class="">We have talked extensively in this article about funnels and that’s because the concept of a sales funnel is well known and well-understood. However, funnels don’t do justice to the whole picture, and a few years ago HubSpot came up with a new concept – the flywheel and changed their whole business strategy to work to this very different model.</p><p class="">The problem with a funnel is that the customer becomes an objective or an outcome of a sales process, and not the centre of the business. And where this really matters is once the prospect has signed up and become a paying customer.</p><p class="">The delight stage – existing customers who are happy and are prepared to act as advocates for your company, powers the attract and engage phases.</p><p class="">In the latest <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/3476323/State%20of%20Inbound%202018%20Global%20Results.pdf" target="_blank"><span>HubSpot State of Inbound Survey (2018</span></a>) respondents said that they got information before making a purchase from a variety of sources:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Word of mouth referrals (55%)</p></li><li><p class="">Customer references (46%)</p></li><li><p class="">Media Articles (38%)</p></li><li><p class="">Vendor-authored materials (blogs etc) (38%)</p></li><li><p class="">…/</p></li><li><p class="">Salesperson (22%)</p></li></ul><p class="">That means if you nurture not only your leads but also your existing customers, they can become a more important force to attract new customers than sales. Given how difficult it is to prospect for new business, looking after your customers and building advocacy and referral programmes around them is a very good way not only to protect your business but to grow it.</p><blockquote><p class=""><em>Thanks for reading and I hope it helps.

Perhaps you’ve even tried it and not seen the results you hoped for. So, does it really work and why has it become part of our lexicon?</p><h3>A shift in the balance of power</h3><p class="">I grew up in the golden age of TV advertising in the UK. Everything from cigars to “healthy” sugar-drenched muesli, booze, chocolate, toys, giant companies, making incredible mini-films to tell me (and my Mum and Dad) what to buy at Christmas, what to put on the Saturday shopping list, where to get platform boots and every other conceivable product or service, and how my detergent was scientifically proven to wash clothes whiter.</p><p class="">That was the way product promotion was done for 40 years. It was fun, sometimes more fun than the TV programmes that interrupted our favourite ads, brash, interruptive, and it really worked.</p><h3>The Shift</h3><p class="">The shift came, of course, with the internet, and more specifically, social media. Two important dynamics emerged:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">With the development of search engines, would-be buyers could research their own solutions without going to suppliers at all. The reviewer, previously confined to art and film critics, became a hugely important part of the marketing mix.</p></li></ul><p class="">Inevitably, the celebrity classes cashed in, now becoming expensive influencers, but the most important opinions were out there for free on the internet, and they still are. Wonderful for buyers, but a nightmare for suppliers because these reviewers are hard to control. Because of that, they are trusted, their opinions have power.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">The second dynamic to emerge is the rise of DIY advertising. Marketing agencies find it really tough these days because of the amazing tools put into the hands of anyone who wants to promote a product or service. Google and all the social media channels have incredible targeting tools to allow any ad to hit its target audience anywhere in the world and their rates for promoted content are as cheap as chips!</p></li></ul><p class="">YouTube has been a major force – it is now so easy to make a promotional video that looks slick enough – and to be honest, we’ve all become a lot more accepting of the less-polished promotional video as a result.</p><h3>What does it mean?</h3><p class="">Buyers have more power than ever before. They have more choice; they have access to client opinion so do not need to talk to a salesperson until they are ready to purchase.</p><p class="">Suppliers must contend with this and thanks to content delivery algorithms that give advantage to channels producing high-volume content there is more ‘noise’ than there has ever been. It’s no longer the remarkable but limited TV ads of giant corporations – everyone is at it and the chances of an unsupported supplier being found in the cacophonous internet marketplace are almost nil.</p><h3>Being seen and being heard</h3><p class="">Customer service shouldn’t have changed – but it has. In the past, it was possible to cover up shoddy products and services but now it’s not. This is because the internet is not only a great democratising force and a giant amplifier of promotional noise – it’s also a merciless spotlight, focused on the good and bad things that companies do and revealing them through the medium of the reviewer.</p><h3>Dealing with the new paradigm</h3><p class="">There has to be a way that takes up the challenge of this new paradigm – extreme competition, merciless exposure and complete buyer control and this is where inbound marketing comes in.</p><h3>Understand your buyer – be relevant</h3><p class="">If more than 50% of start-ups fail because they have built a product that no one wants, it is axiomatic to state that you need to deeply understand your buyer. Today, you cannot tell them what they need – you have to listen to what they are saying to you.</p><p class="">There are many tools and research techniques to do this, and we have touched upon several of them in our <a href="https://flagshipmarketing.com/blog/why-fintechs-need-to-do-more-customer-research">customer research blog</a> and <a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/s/How-to-Create-Buyer-Personas.pdf">buyer persona creation workbooks</a>. Here we are not interested in how but what and why, because unless that is clear, the how is simply a curiosity.</p><h3>Help your buyer</h3><p class="">Once you understand them, work out how you can help them. What do you have in your product and service portfolio that <a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/blog/why-should-your-prospect-buy-from-you-positioning-in-fintech">meets your customer’s needs</a>? But you can’t help anyone if you can’t be seen or found and this is where we have to deal with the cacophony of the digital marketplace.</p><h3>Build your discoverability</h3><p class="">The key to this is <a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/s/A-fresh-look-at-SEO.pdf">search engine optimisation (SEO)</a>. When your buyers embark on a voyage of discovery towards the solution they will ultimately buy, they will not know that some voices are speaking to them louder than others. That’s because they will never hear the quiet voices, even if those people have a perfect answer to the buyers’ needs.</p><p class="">Is this a problem for the buyer? Not really. The search engine algorithms are designed to put the most relevant and popular content in front of the user, and there is so much choice available, that the buyer will almost certainly find something to help. The problem is entirely in the lap of the providers of goods services that can’t be heard.</p><p class="">The problem is not insurmountable – many have been there and done it – but they take time to bear fruit and knowledge of the way the internet really works.</p><h3>Deliver what you promise</h3><p class="">This is a virtuous circle – nothing is more important. To avoid the glare of the internet, never let your guard slip in terms of providing the best customer service you can.</p><p class="">Have a strategy for the times when things do go wrong which includes brutal honesty, a deep understanding of how your shortcomings have affected your customers, a plan to recompense them for any problems which you have caused and a plan to make sure it doesn’t happen again. The chances are you will not escape all the fallout, but you will have done everything you could possibly do to regain the trust and the support of your customers.</p><p class="">On the other hand, if you do build your reputation as a reliable, honest, relevant provider, you will start to enjoy the benefits of the internet – strong reviews, advocacy, client-generated content, referrals and maybe even support in designing your next generation of products and services.</p><h3>Inbound marketing - does it really work?</h3><p class="">Throughout this blog, I’ve described the characteristics of inbound marketing setting against a paradigm shift of buyer control through the internet.</p><p class="">I’ve avoided a definition until this point because definitions have a habit of making people switch off. “Oh! That’s what it means. OK, I’ve understood this now – thanks!” To do that would be to gloss over or ignore the imperatives that make traditional marketing less effective than it used to be.</p><p class="">But in order to answer the question, “Does it work”, we need to define what “it” is – so here goes.</p><h3>Inbound marketing&nbsp;</h3><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">is a strategy – it is not an activity but a whole approach to deal with the paradigm shift</p></li><li><p class="">the strategic goal is normally attracting leads and new business</p></li><li><p class="">the main approach is to create content that is helpful and relevant</p></li><li><p class="">in order to improve your discoverability over time</p></li><li><p class="">and to appeal to customers that are ALREADY INTERESTED in what you have to say because it aligns with their own search for a solution</p></li><li><p class="">the aim is not to interrupt or annoy uninterested people but to connect with those already looking for you</p></li></ol><h3>Does it work?</h3><p class="">If you follow the logic of what’s happened to buyers and sellers over the last 20 years, it is clear that something like inbound marketing would need to have been created to manage the new paradigm. And the answer is, yes it does work. I know this, not only from our own experience but also from the testimony and <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/case-studies?__hstc=114228120.c10722a8da0dd6ae8615e83059199467.1548164976540.1577971909645.1577975435100.121&amp;__hssc=114228120.8.1577975435100&amp;__hsfp=2240718579"><span>case studies</span></a> of hundreds of other practitioners and those that have been served by it.

If you want a more concentrated view, have a look at the <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/case-studies/?__hstc=114228120.c10722a8da0dd6ae8615e83059199467.1548164976540.1577971909645.1577975435100.121&amp;__hssc=114228120.8.1577975435100&amp;__hsfp=2240718579"><span>HubSpot case studies</span></a>, all of which testify to the effectiveness off inbound marketing, done well.</p><p class="">It should also be clear that this is not a quick fix – you are struggling against all the noise in the marketplace – and that you cannot just dive into writing content without first doing the research. The more you understand, the more you will create relevant content, and the more you are relevant, the more quickly you will be found by the search engines and your buyers. It takes time – maybe even a year before you breakthrough.</p><p class="">For that reason, people starting out with inbound marketing often run ad campaigns and carry on with traditional ‘outbound’ sales too. That’s not a bad thing – these approaches haven’t completely stopped, and they can be enhanced with the inbound principles of being relevant and helpful, researching like crazy and applying all that knowledge into any advertising campaign you do.</p><p class="">But it should also be clear that once you have achieved the goal of being discovered and being helpful, a more sustainable, higher quality and cheaper source of leads should flow from your inbound campaigns. Then it is a question of continuing to persevere – to research, to refine, to build your advocates and build your business.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f983681a3b29f646dbd85fe/1612972953109-QE8IFG3W9963ES5U9BD0/word-processing.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="500" height="333"><media:title type="plain">Does inbound marketing really work?</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>What happens when you engage your customers properly...and when you don’t</title><category>Fintech</category><dc:creator>Jamie Dalton</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 11:17:50 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/blog/what-happens-when-you-engage-your-customers-properlyand-when-you-dont</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f983681a3b29f646dbd85fe:5f994a83a7b60175a5a43ffd:5f9bf5efaa50105028d98cc0</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong><em>Another meaningless buzzword?</em></strong></p><p class=""><strong><em>No, not this time.

OK let’s get the definition out of the way and then we can dive into the problem and what it means for you.</em></strong></p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Brodie references three academic authors on the subject of Customer Engagement (CE) to come up with a powerful proposition, <em>“(CE) represents a</em> <strong><em>strategic imperative</em></strong> <em>for generating enhanced corporate performance, including</em> <strong><em>sales growth</em></strong> <em>(Neff 2007), superior</em> <strong><em>competitive advantage</em></strong> <em>(Sedley 2008), and</em> <strong><em>profitability</em></strong> <em>(Voyles 2007).</em></p></li><li><p class="">Wikipedia talks about a <strong>connection</strong> made between stakeholders of an organisation</p></li><li><p class="">Hollabeek et al, describe CE as <em>"the level of a customer’s</em> <strong><em>cognitive</em></strong><em>,</em> <strong><em>emotional</em></strong> <em>and</em> <strong><em>behavioral</em></strong> <em>investment in specific brand interactions,"</em></p></li></ul><p class="">(emphasis mine in all quotes)</p><h3>Look where that leaves us</h3><p class="">Putting it together we learn that, if you can tap into a customer’s INVESTMENT in your products and services, creating a strong connection between you and them, you can build growth and profitability and in doing so, leave your competitors in the dust.</p><p class="">No wonder Jack Neff described it as a strategic imperative. But there are many pieces to this puzzle that have to be thought through if you are to build a successful strategy from these insights.</p><h3>Let’s start with a thought experiment</h3><p class="">One good place to start is with you. You are a customer, and you have good and bad experiences to draw on. Here are two questions to get you thinking and one to get you doing.

All truly very good and all missing the point.</p><p class="">What point? That the how is less important than the what. It’s easy to deflect the question so that we come up with a list of techniques. But what we really need is answers to fundamental questions from our customers:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">What do they want from us?</p></li><li><p class="">What do they find useful?</p></li><li><p class="">What things will continue to be useful over time</p></li><li><p class="">What keeps them coming back?</p></li><li><p class="">Why are we different?</p></li><li><p class="">Where should we focus our efforts?</p></li></ul><p class="">Behind these fundamental questions are a host of more specific data-gathering opportunities – IF we have engagement KPIs in place – and most people don’t.</p><h3>Co-creating value</h3><p class="">The key thing about engagement is that the supplier and the customer co-create value. What does that mean?</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Well, you as a supplier solve a problem for a client. The client in return pays for it. You then draw the client in deeper with some amazing support, so they feel secure, and trust builds.</p></li><li><p class="">You then give them access to better tools, loyalty benefits and so on, and they start telling their friends about you.</p></li><li><p class="">You then provide them with an opportunity to help co-design your next product – what services and features would be most useful?</p></li></ul><p class="">Over time the relationship has become symbiotic – mutually fruitful. Do you want more leads through referrals – or are you focused on retaining your existing client base and making it more and more loyal?</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Client service KPIs such as:</p></li><li><p class="">Client retention rates</p></li><li><p class="">Client lifetime value</p></li><li><p class="">Client attrition rates</p></li><li><p class="">Answering times</p></li><li><p class="">% problem resolution</p></li><li><p class="">Client satisfaction</p></li><li><p class="">Client referrals / reviews / advocacy</p></li><li><p class="">Collaboration</p></li></ul><p class="">speak more to loyalty and retention, whereas engagement with lead-generating content on social media and ads; clicks, shares, and conversions are the type of engagement metric that drives new business, along with:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Client acquisition cost</p></li><li><p class="">Content engagement: Shares, retweets, click-through rate and conversions</p></li></ul><h3>How important is customer experience?</h3><p class="">A few years ago a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/customer-experience-battlefield/"><span>Gartner study</span></a> claimed 89% of marketing leaders (respondents) believed they would be competing on the basis of customer experience by 2017. The same study revealed that 44% of consumers described their customer experience as <strong>bland.</strong></p><p class="">How true is this of your company, and what can you do about it?</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Don’t sell a product, show your customer you understand them</p></li><li><p class="">Engage your staff in the delivery of customer experience (a blog in its own right!)</p></li><li><p class="">Work emotionally as well as rationally with your customers</p></li><li><p class="">Offer the opportunity for your clients to interact with you</p></li><li><p class="">Ask for feedback, assess it, rinse and repeat</p></li></ul><p class="">To bring us right up to date, the latest <a href="https://www.newvoicemedia.com/resources/serial-switchers-swayed-by-sentiment-how-bad-emotive-customer-experiences-are-costing-brands-billions"><span>Serial Switchers’ Survey </span></a>asked the question, “What difference would it make if you had a good customer experience?” Here’s what they said:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">55 per cent of respondents indicated they would be more loyal,</p></li><li><p class="">47 per cent would recommend the company to others,</p></li><li><p class="">26 per cent would use the company more frequently if they could</p></li><li><p class="">26 per cent would spend more money.</p></li></ul><p class="">What would that mean for you and your business?</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f983681a3b29f646dbd85fe/1612972869992-AB7AJLR9OVYRL1MQL9EB/men-having-a-soft-drink.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="500" height="334"><media:title type="plain">What happens when you engage your customers properly...and when you don’t</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>FinTechs need a reason to survive</title><category>Positioning</category><category>Fintech</category><dc:creator>Jamie Dalton</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 11:15:47 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/blog/fintechs-need-a-reason-to-survive</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f983681a3b29f646dbd85fe:5f994a83a7b60175a5a43ffd:5f9bf594b12c5e30f4645bd3</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">FinTechs want to do things better than their financial predecessors. Of course, they do - that's the point! And for some of them, simply doing better isn't enough - they want to turn the world upside down.</p><p class="">Take TransferWise. Nearly four years ago, American financial and business news website Business Insider, reported on TransferWise's reaction to the Occupy movement some years previously. They said, “We want this to be a revolution in finance and not evolution. This is the start of something very fundamental."</p><p class="">Most of our articles are educational - how to do CRO or manage your metrics. But occasionally we write about <a href="https://flagshipmarketing.com/blog/define-your-purpose-to-help-position-your-fintech-firm">purpose</a> - which characterises the firms we want to work with and explains why we are in this industry.</p><p class="">Usually, we write in practical terms such as <a href="https://flagshipmarketing.com/blog/define-your-purpose-to-help-position-your-fintech-firm" target="_blank">Using your purpose to position your FinTech</a> but the revolutionary spirit of the FinTech movement goes beyond practicalities, speaking to the unique values of this sector of the financial services industry, and showing why some FinTechs are truly worth investing in.</p><h3>FinTechs should at least bring efficiency to finance</h3><p class="">The catalyst for the FinTech movement was the global financial collapse in 2008. This led to an overwhelming feeling that the banks had set aside any idea of fairness in pursuit of maximising shareholder value, using steam-driven legacy systems that were inefficient even when inefficiency wasn't a deliberate part of the business model.</p><p class="">At its birth, the nascent FinTech sector set out to challenge the cynicism of the banks and had amazing success. From the beginning, the banks were running scared, faced with implacable hostility from both the public and from challenger firms.</p><p class="">Over time, the strength of the banking franchise has produced a different dynamic - partnership - with the banks keen to exploit new technologies to make their operations cheaper and more effective.</p><p class="">Judging by the continuing fines to the major banking houses, the FinTech movement may not have overcome the cynical rule-breaking of the banks, but they have forced the incumbents to re-evaluate new technical and business models and brought new efficiency to the industry.</p><p class="">That may not sound like revolution but we think the positive effects of this quieter battle will be felt for years to come. Bringing efficiency to a grinding system is a purpose well worth pursuing.</p><p class="">Some FinTechs however, have gone further.</p><h3>Tackling poverty and injustice</h3><p class="">A few years ago, I listened to a speaker from IJM, a charity which deals with modern slavery, and recently I heard his colleague speak in Brussels. He said something which made me sit up and take notice:</p><p class="">"Communities which cannot support a population (or parts of a population) open up the possibility that the world must be better elsewhere – and that leads to migration."</p><p class="">Migrants are vulnerable – in fact, they are a major supplier to the slave industry because they have left the security of their own communities.</p><p class="">One of the unintended consequences of the much-needed prudential regulation arising from the events of 2008 has been the withdrawal of banking services from developing economies, triggering the collapse of correspondent banking relationships in some Asian and sub-Saharan African economies.</p><p class="">This has put local economies under severe pressure - and at risk of migration.</p><p class="">Governments and supranational organisations are now doing much to tackle the problem, and FinTech firms focused on banking inclusion are playing their part too.</p><p class="">The European Investment Bank in its <a href="https://www.eib.org/attachments/general/events/africa_day_2017_roundtable_proceedings.pdf"><span>Roundtable on Digital Financial inclusion in sub-Saharan Africa 2017</span></a> noted that,</p><blockquote><p class=""><em>"Mobile and digital technologies have helped boost financial inclusion in sub-Saharan Africa significantly in recent years. The percentage of adults with an account rose from 24% in 2011 to 34% in 2014. </em><strong><em>Mobile money services provided by FinTechs and Telcos are increasingly filling the gaps left by traditional banks.</em></strong> (emphasis ours)</p></blockquote><p class="">These are purposeful organisations, which in some cases make very healthy profits, but have a reason to exist beyond that, which is clear and distinctive and effective.</p><p class="">Your purpose may be entirely different...and that's great</p><p class="">I'm truly glad there are organisations that have banking inclusion as their mission - but it doesn't have to be yours. However, the really successful FinTech companies do all have a purpose, and it isn't profit!</p><p class=""><em>Profit is never a purpose for being in business - it is a consequence of doing your business well. That's what the banks discovered in 2008.</em></p><h3>A worrying FinTech trend</h3><p class="">As a marketer, I'm really interested in your purpose, whatever it is. Your purpose informs your values; your mission; your value proposition; your online value proposition; your target market; your products and service; your positioning; your communications strategy; your goals...you get the point!</p><p class="">As a market specialist, we see a lot of FinTech firms - that's one of the advantages an agency brings to a firm that it serves. Very few, if any, firms will spend the time we do understanding the depth and breadth of the industry - and that's true for any agency, not just us.</p><p class="">And I am frankly concerned at the number of FinTech firms that don't seem to have a purpose beyond profit. They are the copycat organisations, not differentiating themselves from pioneering and successful FinTechs that have gone before.</p><p class="">Now the FinTech market is still in a bubble - funding is plentiful and investors can make spectacular returns on outstanding start-ups and scale-ups. Even better, the financial incumbents still want to partner with smart, agile FinTechs.</p><p class="">But that won't last forever, and when it goes, the me-too purposeless firms will go too, taking their investors' cash, and their own, down the tube as they go.</p><p class="">Why? Because they have no reason to exist, and when the market tightens, the focus will be on those firms that have a point to them - there won't be any appetite for the rest.</p><p class="">What will remain are the excellent organisations that know why they exist, who they are serving and what good they are doing - like those making sure everyone can get insurance protection, those helping small business to grow and those making our world safer and more inclusive.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f983681a3b29f646dbd85fe/1604398256659-MUXOQMPMEEB8BE92HB6A/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="1201"><media:title type="plain">FinTechs need a reason to survive</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Great team, great product, but how can I generate more leads?</title><category>Inbound Marketing</category><category>Marketing Automation</category><category>CRO</category><category>Fintech</category><dc:creator>Jamie Dalton</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 11:13:19 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/blog/great-team-great-product-but-how-can-i-generate-more-leads</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f983681a3b29f646dbd85fe:5f994a83a7b60175a5a43ffd:5f9bf4c2bd2903222db94abc</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong><em>If you have built a great product, assembled an awesome team, but the customers are just not coming, what can you do about it?”</em></strong></p><h3>The top reason why start-ups fail</h3><p class="">Start-ups fail when they are not providing a solution to their market’s problems. The ‘solution-looking-for-a-problem’ is, according to market-insight leaders, <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/"><span>CBInsights</span></a>, the most common reason why start-ups fail (42%).</p><p class="">The obvious conclusion is that start-ups share a tendency to not research their markets properly – or at all, basing their solutions on the experiences of the founders who struggled with a particular activity in a previous life.</p><p class="">These experiences are translated into generic needs, giving rise to a wonderful product. Unfortunately, nobody else seems to share the pain sufficiently to want to buy the product.</p><p class="">That is not to say that the solution is really useless, at all. That’s rarely the case. In the CBInsights study, the founder of a failed start-up says that they realised too late that doctors want more patients, not more efficient offices.</p><p class="">Being the son of a doctor, the son-in-law of a doctor and having 4 cousins who are doctors, I can say with some certainty (although I would still research the point thoroughly) that doctors, at least in the UK, are not looking for more patients. They are looking for more support to get through the huge workloads they face so that they can treat their patients better.</p><p class="">It may have been a question of positioning the product differently or looking at different locations within the sector (e.g. UK v USA) or changing the pricing or the way it was delivered. Adding a missing feature may have made all the difference or it could have been a matter of improving communications; but until the market has been researched, it’s impossible to know.</p><h3>Research</h3><p class="">As we wrote in our article, “<a href="https://flagshipmarketing.com/blog/why-fintechs-need-to-do-more-customer-research">Why FinTechs need to do more customer research</a>, <em>“the entrepreneurial spirit often does not have much room for the methodical details of research”</em>.</p><p class="">We believe that failing to carry out research into market need is endemic in the start-up psyche, and that is borne out by the CBInsights study.</p><p class="">The problem is, if someone has built a product and clients haven’t come, they don’t have an infinite amount of time in which to research the market and then take the appropriate actions.</p><p class="">It’s not impossible – but it takes a great deal of courage and humility. They need to pivot.</p><h3>Pivot</h3><p class="">Pivoting means moving away from plan A which got you into the predicament, and moving to plan B, which will be a better strategy because it has been properly researched and analysed.</p><p class="">It’s time to get some help.</p><h3>What does help look like?</h3><p class="">There are 3 reasons to look for external help in situations like this: expertise, resources and objectivity.</p><p class="">You can expect an external agency to focus on a few things – quickly, not taking months:</p><h4>1. Undertaking a situation analysis to assess</h4><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Size of market</p></li><li><p class="">Needs of market</p></li><li><p class="">Competitor landscape</p></li><li><p class="">A SWOT of your business</p></li></ol><p class="">If you have clients, they will certainly want to talk to them to understand why they bought from you, what they like about the product and you as a company, and what they don’t.</p><p class="">In this process, they should agree on SMART objectives with you, so that everyone is working towards the same goals. The time element of SMART is extremely important when money is tight.</p><h4>2. <a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/s/Flagship-Marketing-Positioning-Statement-Workbook.pdf">Product&nbsp;</a><span>positioning</span></h4><p class="">We can define positioning as the process to put a product or a service into a particular niche in the minds of potential consumers.</p><p class="">At the heart of positioning is understanding your prospects' pain points and challenges. If you want to help people who are fed up with paying exorbitant fees for forex payments what’s the real need?</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Is it fees?</p></li><li><p class="">or the time it takes to complete a transfer?</p></li><li><p class="">or the complexity of the process they have to go through?</p></li><li><p class="">or the (un)reliability of providers' portals?</p></li><li><p class="">or insufficient geographical coverage?</p></li><li><p class="">or the difficulty of reaching unbanked constituents?</p></li></ol><p class="">Can you solve for all of them, some of them or only for one?</p><p class="">How big is the problem, and how severe is the pain? If it’s not severe enough then the solution will have to be very easy and inexpensive to implement – but if there is a huge market and you can leverage economies of scale, that may not be an issue for your business.</p><h4>3. Creating at least one <a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/s/How-to-Create-Buyer-Personas.pdf">buyer persona</a></h4><p class="">This is a fictitious representation of one of your sweet-spot customers, understanding what drives them to buy, what inhibits them, where they are located, how they consume information and so on.</p><p class="">This helps to direct all the communications an agency needs to make on your behalf to start bringing in those customers.</p><p class="">I know this seems like a lot of navel-gazing at a point of crisis, but this is the minimum work that 42% of failing start-ups fail to do, and it is what brings them to this moment of crisis, so it essential for an agency employed to help to do the minimum in order to give the best chance of a successful turnaround.</p><p class="">In an ideal world, you would devote 3-6 months to the business planning process, but here we are talking about a matter of a few weeks at most.</p><p class="">Let’s look at the second reason startups fail. Between them, the top two reasons account for more than 70% of start-up failures.</p><h3>The second reason why start-ups fail</h3><p class="">The number 2 reason why start-ups fail, is that they simply run out of cash. Does this sound familiar?</p><p class="">Can you see the sand trickling through the hourglass and feel the urgency to generate some business, soon? You’re not alone.</p><p class="">29% of the failed start-ups surveyed by CBInsights had used up all their funding before they generated sufficient revenue to make their businesses viable.</p><p class="">Assuming that there is a market for the products and services being offered, we have to look at other reasons to explain why customers are not signing up in sufficient numbers to save the business: These might include the following*:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">You’re invisible to the market – no one knows you</p></li><li><p class="">Even If they find you, they don’t trust you, because you’re too small, or they’ve never heard of you</p></li><li><p class="">They don’t understand your product, so they don’t know why they need it</p></li><li><p class="">They worry about integration with existing tech or practices</p></li><li><p class="">Price or other positioning issues as we discussed above</p></li></ol><p class=""><em>*Listen to</em> <a href="https://conversion-rate-experts.com/">Conversion-Rate Experts</a><em>’ awesome podcast “Making Websites Win” to hear this list in its original context.</em></p><h3>What does help look like, now?</h3><p class="">Armed with the research, the positioning and the buyer personas, the agency can begin to implement a strategy to get your business back on track. There is no magic bullet, but there are lots of things that can be done depending on the reason that customers are not signing up.</p><h3>Max out sales productivity</h3><p class="">Perhaps you think you’re sales team has been working at maximum efficiency, but unless you are supporting them with some tool to automate their efforts, they’re not.</p><p class="">We use HubSpot Sales suite. It’s not the only good platform out there, but it is amazing value for startups with funding who may be able to qualify for 90% discount in the first year. <a href="mailto:info@flagshipmarketing.com?subject=Info%20about%20HubSpot"><span>Let us know if you need more details from a user perspective</span></a>.</p><p class="">Whatever system you choose should be able to support workflows and sequences that help sales teams to be hyper-efficient. It may seem strange to invest in this now, which is why the price-deal is so important, but even more important is getting your name and your product out there.</p><p class="">If we were working with you, we would expect each one of your salespeople to be contacting 50 prospects a day, using a sequence of automated, personalised emails interspersed with social media connections and direct calls.</p><h3>Use Video</h3><p class="">It is no secret that people respond to video more than to text. But a standard video is no good – it needs to be researched and crafted for the individual client, 50 times a day.</p><p class="">Impossible? Not at all – it’s exactly what we do, and we have impressively improved our open rates as a result.</p><h3>Use the research to be relevant</h3><p class="">The research you have commissioned should inform everything you do – how you speak to your prospects, where you speak to them, the language you use, the problem you solve for; the pricing of your product. All this has been designed to help your sales teams become more relevant and effective.</p><p class="">We can look at this in terms of the potential reasons that customers are not coming to you.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">The optimized sales process will help get more people to know about you, but if you have understood that trust is an issue; you are too small or too new, you need a different communications approach that focuses on your credentials and expertise.</p></li><li><p class="">This might also lead you down a different path to look at partner programs where you can benefit from the market presence and resources of a larger company to support you, train you and hold you accountable, exactly as we do with HubSpot.</p></li><li><p class="">If you have understood that people just don’t see why they need your product – very common for innovative solutions, you will need to focus on the need or opportunity that your product creates and back it up with as much evidence as you can.</p></li><li><p class="">Technical integration can be a big problem in markets like financial services where legacy systems dominate. Yes, they’re expensive, but they are also well-understood and robust, and if you are offering a cloud-based system when everyone is used to mainframes and data centres, you know you have to answer the question about integration before you can deal with the cost-benefit. Why? Because the cost of something going wrong, and the effort of integration often far outweighs the operational savings a new product provides.</p></li></ul><h3>Inbound Marketing</h3><p class="">So far, we’ve talked about sales, automation, video outreach, using the research to boost results.</p><p class="">That’s because this type of selling will provide the quickest results in the short-term. If you follow these rules, use the research and reach the email volumes. Going back to our examples above – if you are in this situation, the lack of time will be a bigger issue than the cost of client acquisition in the short-term.</p><p class="">BUT in the long-term, this type of selling is more expensive and less efficient than a technique called <a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/s/Flagship-Marketing-Guide-to-Generating-Inbound-Leads.pdf">inbound marketing</a>.</p><p class="">Although inbound marketing will take longer to generate leads, once the pipeline is full and flowing there will be far more leads than cold calling can produce, and those leads will be easier for your sales team to convert too. This means we need to run the two strategies in parallel because we must look beyond the short-term issue to the future of the company.</p><h3>What is inbound marketing?</h3><p class="">Inbound marketing is the process of attracting customers to a company’s products and services through content that helps them as they seek a solution to their needs</p><p class="">The internet has created a new paradigm – a shift in the balance of power between buyer and seller. Now it’s easy. Prospects can research a solution to their needs long before they talk to a buyer, and the place where they do their research is online.</p><p class="">That is why details about your products and services must be discoverable to those people who need it, when they need it.</p><p class="">Techniques like search engine optimisation (SEO, see below) are employed to ensure the information can be found when someone is searching for an answer, and the content is placed on social media channels where people might be looking.</p><p class="">The key is that when a customer gets in touch, they are already seeking what you are offering, and that makes them far more receptive to your offer.</p><h3>What to expect</h3><p class="">In our own experience of using these techniques, the first thing that happens in that your SEO ranking begins to rise.</p><p class="">That means, when people search for the thing you are solving for, your website or landing pages appear higher up in the list of answers that Google or the other search engines like Bing, provide.</p><p class="">When people search for a particular solution, they only tend to look at the top 5 answers, so ranking highly answers the objection – no one knows about you or your products.</p><p class="">You will get some leads, but sporadically and unpredictably. In the early stages. They won’t follow the conversion paths you think they might but will come in because you just resonate with their needs.</p><p class=""> As time goes on, the volume of interest grows as you become even more discoverable. At this point, the conversion paths stabilise, and we will get a steady flow of marketing qualified leads through your door. Because these leads are ‘inbound’ i.e. they approach you because they’re interested in what you are solving for, they are relatively easy to convert compared to cold leads.</p><h3>Conversion Rate Optimisation</h3><p class="">Once your agency has helped you generate a good number of leads, they can work with you to optimise the conversion rates using the data they generate.</p><p class="">This is a process that looks at every type of communication and every element of that communication, and experiments with controls and variants to arrive at the optimal point where more and more of the recipients of your communication are behaving in the ways you want them to.</p><p class="">Things that can be optimised include</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Headlines</p></li><li><p class="">Taglines</p></li><li><p class="">Blog copy</p></li><li><p class="">Forms</p></li><li><p class="">Calls to Action</p></li><li><p class="">Channels</p></li><li><p class="">Timing</p></li><li><p class="">Position on the page</p></li></ol><p class="">...and many more.</p><p class="">This is a scientific approach to improving your effectiveness, with guesswork eliminated. It takes quite a lot of traffic in order to be most effective, so it’s not an early part of the strategy, but over time it becomes essential to break through into high levels of success.</p><h3>Service</h3><p class=""> At this stage, once you have a good local client base, you need to look carefully at service. Retention strategies are a key part of the marketing mix and they too benefit from automation, instant help from bots, comprehensive client knowledge contained in a form that is readily accessible to support staff, and so on.</p><p class="">These delighted clients are ideally placed to join your sales team! They can write reviews, inform their supply chain, link to you from their websites, (which is good for your SEO) and become a free (but priceless) resource for your product design team.</p><h3>Choosing your help</h3><p class="">There are lots of skill sets that you need to see from your agency when you are trying to recover from that less than wonderful strategic start.</p><p class="">Research, content provision, search engine optimisation, conversion rate optimisation, marketing and sales automation, SEO, social media distribution expertise are the key ones.</p><p class="">Marketers are not salespeople – they work with markets not with individual accounts and their role is to hand over leads at a mutually agreed point so that the sales teams can use their expertise to nurture and close the leads. Nevertheless, in these very difficult times, an agency that cannot roll up its sleeves and support the sales effort in becoming as productive and effective as possible, is not what you need.</p><p class="">They also need to work hand-in-glove with in-house marketing teams.

What I mean is, it could be to adorn you or your home, feed you and your family, help you relax, or get from A to B or survive an avalanche or cure a verruca!</p><p class="">Even a lowly apple is doing a job for you, meeting a need.</p><p class="">What does this have to do with buyer personas?</p><blockquote><p class="">The theory is, that people in similar circumstances are likely to experience the same needs and behave in similar ways</p></blockquote><p class="">So, a mum may need toys, childcare, adequate transport and so on.</p><p class="">You can make an assumption that she is concerned about the welfare of her child because we know most mothers are. So she may need safety equipment, shoe-fitting services and the like.</p><p class="">You can, therefore, assume that promoting these items will be relevant, but the way in which you communicate them and the place in which you communicate them may not resonate as well as your competitors' marketing efforts. We need to know more</p><h3>Don't guess</h3><p class="">If you guess about a buyer persona you will probably get it wrong. Research the needs of your prospects, and what they do in response to those needs. To learn more about customer research check out our <a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/s/Flagship-Marketing-Guide-to-Generating-Inbound-Leads.pdf">inbound lead generation for Fintechs topic page</a>.</p><p class="">I had exactly this conversation with a charity that organises sponsorship for poor children in education. They assumed that their sponsors would be motivated by the fact that they want to educate their own children about differences in wealth by sponsoring a child of the same age as their own child and establishing a relationship with that child.</p><p class="">A trawl through their sponsorship database reveals that this is partly true, but another (entirely discounted) group is an older demographic, wealthy retirees for whom the motivations are very different. They've never been talked to, targeted in any way - they just are - and no one knows anything about what drives them, what they like or dislike, what their needs are, how to retain them for as long as possible and so on.</p><p class="">In short, we don't yet know enough about this group except to say they form a considerable support base for this charity.</p><p class="">Guessing is reckless. Data is always the right answer.</p><h3>I don't have data - I'm a startup!</h3><p class="">You may not think you have data, but there are many ways to build a buyer profile:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">if you have customers, even a few - talk to them</p></li><li><p class="">you can survey broader markets</p></li><li><p class="">you can use forms on landing pages to get information</p></li><li><p class="">you can look a wealth of online analytical data to find out what your buyer characteristics are</p></li><li><p class="">and when you have them, you can communicate respectfully and relevantly about their needs and your solution.</p></li></ul><p class="">Buyer personas take some work to get into shape, but they will pay dividends if you are diligent about creating them and keeping them up to date, and they will give you an advantage over the majority of your competitors who won't bother.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f983681a3b29f646dbd85fe/1612972603939-554CZG5FZOS6E1OVOQ7C/chatting-people.jpg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="500" height="333"><media:title type="plain">Are buyer personas really necessary?</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>How to make your calls-to-action work better</title><dc:creator>Jamie Dalton</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 11:09:36 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/blog/how-to-make-your-calls-to-action-work-better</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f983681a3b29f646dbd85fe:5f994a83a7b60175a5a43ffd:5f9bf39e0b7cb706ac60936d</guid><description><![CDATA[<h3>What are Calls to Action?</h3><p class="">Those little buttons with “learn more” and “download now” are examples of calls to action (CTAs). Although many are in button form, they can be in banners, embedded in images or other forms.</p><p class="">The aim of the CTA is to invite or tempt a reader or listener to take some action now, or very occasionally at a later date, in a succinct phrase, normally a verb and a qualifier, but it can just be the verb, “submit”, or it can be longer “Use your business to help someone today”.</p><h3>How do they work?</h3><p class="">You can read 100 articles on the colour, size, location and special words to put on your CTA banner or button. Do they make a difference?</p><p class="">Yes, they probably do, but you’ll have to test different options to know which one works best. But before we look at testing, here is a short story that reveals 3 things that are more important than location and colour.</p><h3>Calls to Action – a short story</h3><p class="">Imagine you’re a bank and you are struggling with legacy systems to control credit card issuance and management. You’re reading about a great system from a start-up company that offers an excellent cloud-based system that will decimate your costs and increase your control tenfold.</p><p class="">Your appetite is whetted, and you’re more than interested: it’s relevant and timely. At the end of the article, there’s a button. It’s big – you can’t miss it, acid green with bold lettering, and it says...</p><blockquote><p class="">.<strong>..want more great articles like this?</strong></p><p class=""><strong>Subscribe to our blog, here</strong></p></blockquote><p class="">Oh boy, does this fail as a CTA! 👎</p><p class=""> Let’s rewind!</p><p class="">Somehow you find yourself reading the article again. Once again, you feel that excitement and you’re hooked all the way through, but when you get to the bottom of the article the CTA has changed, and now it reads...</p><blockquote><p class=""><strong>...to move your system to the cloud today,</strong></p><p class=""><strong>click here</strong></p></blockquote><p class="">Now, you’re confused. You’re not ready to jump straight into a migration. This is a complex matter and you need time to be informed and educated, and, even if you are the CEO, to consult with others.</p><p class="">If the author really understood you, they would give you a CTA that says</p><blockquote><p class=""><strong>Learn how moving to our system will help your business decimate its costs and increase your control tenfold</strong></p></blockquote><p class="">Yes sure, it’s a little long and clunky, but sometimes it’s not about slick wordsmithing (testing will tell you). If it speaks to you and touches you about a challenge or an opportunity, the CTA has done its job.</p><p class="">So, here are the 3 takeaways from our story. CTAs must:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">deliver on the promises being made</p></li><li><p class="">be relevant to the needs of a reader</p></li><li><p class="">meet the reader at the exact point where he or she is on their buying journey</p></li></ol><h3>How to apply these 3 takeaways so that more people respond to your offers</h3><p class="">Hidden inside our three takeaways are principles and techniques that must be applied to ensure your CTA’s will really help your reader and boost your business.</p><p class=""><strong>If you don’t know your client how can you expect to be credible?</strong></p><p class="">I know who I am writing this article for. It’s for the Founders and CMOs of FinTech companies, including RegTech and InsurTech firms, who:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Invested in building a product</p></li><li><p class="">Have engaged with marketing techniques such as blogging, making offers, creating landing pages</p></li><li><p class="">Are finding that it’s not working well enough</p></li><li><p class="">Have reached a point where growing their business has become a priority and they’re beginning to focus hard on that rather than product development or other aspects</p></li></ol><h3>Build personas</h3><p class="">Maybe you’re saying, “build what?” Or maybe you’re saying, “I know all about those.” The truth is, very few companies build personas systematically and keep them updated.</p><p class="">But they are the key to understanding your clients, and we wrote about them in this <a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/blog/are-buyer-personas-really-necessary" target="_blank">post about buyer personas</a>.</p><p class="">In a nutshell, personas are the fictitious, generic pen picture of one of your customers. Depending on your business you may only have one or two personas, or you may have many more. To help you create your own we've created this <a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/s/How-to-Create-Buyer-Personas.pdf" target="_blank">buyer persona development workbook </a>for you.</p><p class="">As a FinTech firm, you work in an ultra-competitive environment and you need to be able to pinpoint exactly who you are targeting and solving for.</p><p class="">I saw a LinkedIn post today for a company called Rydoo that said there are more than 100 FinTechs now offering payment solutions.</p><p class="">My guess is that there are even more.</p><p class="">The point is, without knowing your prospects in detail, how can you hope to position your firm uniquely and distinctly form all the copycat firms in your space?</p><p class="">In advertising, especially social media advertising, the tools to be able to target your prospects have become detailed and sophisticated, but you can only take advantage of them if you know what your customer profile looks like.</p><p class="">There are many elements that you can define, but the two most important are:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Demographics – age, location, sex, job title, and most importantly, how and where they consume information, and;</p></li><li><p class="">Psychographics, which relate to emotions – what drives them to buy and what fears and concerns do they have about buying or taking the next step towards a buying decision?</p></li></ul><p class=""><a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/blog/are-buyer-personas-really-necessary">Research your personas</a> through your existing clients, website analytics tools which can provide information on your site’s visitors, through surveys and research, and through your competitors’ sites, wins and losses, reviews, blogs and so on.</p><h3>You have to understand your clients’ conversion path and buyer journey.</h3><p class="">Especially in complex sales, (most FinTech solutions have a degree of complexity or perceived risk), people don’t just buy as if they were getting a bottle of tonic water or a bar of chocolate. (You can see where my thoughts are heading, I know!)</p><p class="">The buying journey in this model consists of 3 phases:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Awareness– where a person wants to better understand the problem they are facing.</p></li><li><p class="">Consideration, where the prospect wants to know about different solution options in order to develop an approach to solving the problem.</p></li><li><p class="">Decision, where the prospect is evaluating possible solution providers.</p></li></ul><p class="">In our story, we offered a “buy now” CTA to a prospect that was still at the Consideration stage, or maybe even at the awareness stage. This prospect wasn’t ready to buy, but he was ready to be educated and informed.</p><h3>Where are you?</h3><p class="">If you were the person that didn’t want to talk to us yet but wanted to research more and understand a particular problem you are facing, you will be in the awareness or consideration stages, depending on whether you have decided your approach or are just still trying to understand the problem.</p><p class="">As a FinTech company, you may well be taking your buyers on a conversion path journey, through initial contacts, blogs, offers, landing pages, and CTAs.</p><p class="">If you don’t understand the conversion path that you are inviting your leads to follow, it is almost inevitable that you will struggle to be relevant and timely with your content, offers and CTAs.</p><h3>A word on testing</h3><p class="">Our biggest enemy in all of this is guesswork.</p><p class="">If you read marketing articles, you will know that everyone is talking about the power of data. That's for two reasons - one we have more access to data than ever before and two - we have more tools to analyse it and better skills as marketers to leverage it.</p><p class="">A/B testing is a useful technique for comparing two similar items, like CTAs and seeing which works best. We will be writing more about this subject in two weeks' time. If you're not doing A/B testing now, you will want to see that article.</p><p class="">However, A/B testing is not the only data analysis we do.

Processes are important but I’m assuming that these business life-skills are taken as read. The real roadblocks came from the fact that those doing the briefing had no idea how to co-create with a creative team to ensure a successful outcome.</p><h3>Yes, let’s get emotional</h3><p class="">Great creative campaigns succeed because of the emotional connection they create between you, your brand and your prospects. Knowing how to brief that into your creative team is the core skill you will bring to making a great online creative campaign.</p><p class="">I hear you say, "Emotions are OK for B2C but not for B2B right?"</p><p class="">Wrong! There is even more emotion in a B2B sale because there is so much more risk in making a B2B decision, especially a considered, complex sale. Does that sound counter-intuitive?</p><p class="">If you buy a car and you don’t really like it, you will be fed up, even very annoyed. If it keeps on breaking down you will complain and try to get things fixed, or eventually, you’ll sell the thing and never buy that make of car again.</p><p class="">If you’re a banking executive and you buy a system to transform your firm’s loans book management, and things start to go wrong, what happens to you? You’ve championed this platform, sold it internally, staked your reputation on it…and it’s not working as you hoped.</p><p class="">So of course, there is a rational part of making a B2B buying decision, but there is also an important emotional part too, about trust, reputation, credibility and "making me look good."</p><h3>Understand your prospects</h3><p class="">As with everything in commercially-based marketing, understanding your prospects is foundational - everything else rests on this.</p><p class="">In our long read, <a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/s/Flagship-Marketing-Guide-to-Generating-Inbound-Leads.pdf">Generating Inbound Leads</a> we talk in more detail about defining a target market and this will influence the direction your online creative journey will follow:</p><p class="">Imagine you are selling an FX system that will provide your prospects with an effective hedge against FX risk. What will your prospects look like?</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">You will encounter <strong>sceptics</strong> for sure.</p></li><li><p class="">If you’re selling into new companies, you will be up against tight budgets, <strong>cost-conscious</strong> founders and partners.</p></li><li><p class="">And if your targets are selling to the public, they may well be talking to their clients about security, <strong>building a future</strong> for themselves their families, and that is where you can use emotion because you know how your clients are engaging with their clients.</p></li></ul><p class=""><strong>Sceptics</strong> can’t see the point – one approach would be to scare them, just like I showed you how an executive might feel if a buying decision went wrong, there is opportunity to show sceptical prospects what might happen, (or what might already be happening) if they <em>don’t</em> take action.</p><p class="">You see a lot of creatives that use this approach, ‘don’t let this be your story’ but unless they are specifically targeting a sceptical audience, it won’t work.</p><p class=""><strong>For the cost-conscious,</strong> you need to show the value you bring. We work with a lot of FinTech firms that don’t have huge marketing budgets and have priorities in other areas, especially product development. We have to work hard to show that the value we bring in terms of new leads and better conversions is worth the spend.</p><p class="">We also have to show that we are the ones who can do it, by demonstrating authority and expertise in the sector. These emotions are not fluffy. They are, to the greatest degree possible, evidence-based, but they engage with an owner’s strong desire to be a success, however, she defines that.</p><p class="">If you’re dealing with <strong>people building a future for their clients</strong> or for their families, you need to tap into the idea that these clients are looking to do this, whatever the financial product is. And here the pitch is all about providing the very best solution for their needs, not the second best, or a good-enough solution because this is their priority.</p><h3>Take the client on a journey</h3><p class="">Once you've understood who your clients are, you need to know something about the route they are taking to making a decision. Buying is a process, not an event. At <a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/">Flagship Marketing</a> we often define the stages of engaging a client as Attract, Convert, Close, Delight but for online creative briefing, we like to use the better-known acronym, AIDA. Attention Interest Desire Action.</p><h4>Get their <strong>attention</strong></h4><p class="">If you have any doubt about the power of emotion to engage with business, watch this video. This is a timeless example of all that we have been talking about. And yes, it’s 5 minutes long, but watch it anyway – if you can do half as well it will take your business outreach to a completely new level! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIEIvi2MuEk"><span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIEIvi2MuEk</span></a></p><h4>Engage their <strong>interest</strong></h4><p class="">If you're an airline, you can say “Our planes are the most fuel-efficient of all the major airlines”, and that will certainly resonate with those who are concerned about the environment.</p><p class="">But you can add, “And that means Bob can visit his sister at Christmas when he didn’t expect to be able to” and told the right way, the story can touch us emotionally in a way that is beyond the worthy, but remote, claims about fuel efficiency.</p><h4>Tap into their <strong>desire</strong></h4><p class="">You run a FinTech company – what’s the biggest desire in your heart that relates to your business? There is a wonderful podcast called “<a href="https://www.moneyneversleeps.ie/"><span>Money Never Sleeps</span></a>”, hosted by a good friend of mine, Pete Townsend, in which entrepreneurs explain how they achieved success, and why. They speak openly and sometimes movingly about what drove them, what they set out to accomplish and why they kept going in times of real adversity and hardship.</p><p class="">Invariably these entrepreneurs have a huge desire to achieve something that fuels their success, helping them to surmount the obstacles they face and win through. That’s what great creative teams want to tap into, but they need you to know what motivates your prospects to design a campaign that touches that desire.</p><h4>Help them <strong>act</strong></h4><p class="">if you've got this far with your campaign, don’t blow it now with an awful call to action such as, “learn more” or worst of all, “submit”. Keep the emotional approach going all the way through the process from your copy to your images or video, to your CTAs, to your landing pages, and your forms and offers:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Don’t let them get ahead</p></li><li><p class="">Join us – you’re so welcome</p></li><li><p class="">Give yourself a chance</p></li><li><p class="">Help yourself</p></li><li><p class="">…or even…</p></li><li><p class="">Banish embarrassing dandruff forever 😊</p></li></ul><h3>Channel your creatives</h3><p class="">Understanding the channels where your prospects gather, goes back to knowing your client, but you will help your creative team bring you success (this is a partnership) if you can explain about the watering holes where your prospects congregate.</p><p class="">I don’t often promote other agencies on our blogs, but I learned about <a href="http://storm81.com/all-marketing-channels"><span>David Sealey</span></a> at the Institute of Digital Marketing, and he has done an extraordinary amount of work on channels; identifying 129 possibilities that marketers have to address their audiences.</p><p class="">Knowing the channels where your prospects consume information will put your creative team in the driving seat and you ahead of your competitors.</p><h3>You need a strong value proposition to help your creative team deliver</h3><p class="">A tutor of mine, who also happened to be a top creative director is called Mike O’Brien. He is remarkable in many ways, not least in my eyes because he has a degree in andragogy – although my clever readers probably know exactly what that is!</p><p class="">Mike defined a value proposition as, “The single-minded expression of an emotional or physical benefit”. For the purpose of designing a creative campaign, that's a near-perfect definition.</p><p class="">Imagine a company that turned regulation into policies for banks to disseminate to their staff. The main feature of the product would be a thoroughly-tested regulatory solution for generating bank policies. But the emotional benefit would be the peace of mind for beleaguered Legal, HR, Risk or Compliance departments. The value proposition should contain both these elements, but often the emotional hook is ignored or forgotten.</p><h3>Too low, too slow</h3><p class="">The reason positioning is so important and the reason why we put so much emphasis on it is because getting it wrong can be genuinely catastrophic. Have a look at this cautionary tale from the beginning of the electric car movement.</p><p class="">Famous entrepreneur and inventor, Sir Clive Sinclair once built an electric car called the C5. It was truly innovative, very different and a huge commercial failure, which ultimately ended in the C5 producers going out of business.</p><p class="">Why did this happen? Because, although he was a brilliant inventor, Sir Clive clearly hadn't done his marketing homework. This lack of marketing insight led him to position his invention against the motor car. But the C5 was slower than a car, it couldn’t carry as much as a car, it offered little protection against the weather and people felt unsafe in such a low, slow vehicle, sucking on the exhaust fumes of the cars around them.</p><p class="">Was the C5 a bad product? Not at all.

What is it that makes these golden business developers so efficient?</em></p><h3>Making time through automation</h3><p class="">Has it ever occurred to you that you these FinTech marketers and salespeople who appear to have more time than you, may actually be doing less than you might think?</p><p class="">Since the birth of the microchip, the key to human progress has been the delegation of repetitive tasks to machines and computers. This is the process that has helped us turn human-led production lines into manufacturing giga-factories capable of producing many thousands of times more product than a human-led production line.</p><p class="">Business development is no different. If we can reduce the labour-intensive but necessary areas of our job, we can spend more time focusing on areas that are both more interesting to us as humans and more important to us as people generating revenue for our businesses.</p><p class="">So how do we do this?</p><p class="">The first step on the quest for efficiency is automation. There are many areas where automation can really help, but here are just three to think about.</p><h3>1) Email outreach for sales</h3><p class="">If your CRM system has the capability to automate email sequences (and other tasks) that can be a great time-saver for marketers and salespeople.</p><p class="">The number of times I have worked with salespeople who spend hours crafting the perfectly-researched, optimised and eloquently written email, finally sending it only to throw all that work away and repeat the process makes me weep. CRM systems like HubSpot have email templating to allow you to write an email once and personalise it, sequences that combine emails and other tasks like phone calls so that you never physically write or send a series of emails until your prospect replies.</p><p class="">Even if you're not using a fully developed marketing automation tool you can create mail merges through a combo of Microsoft Word and Excel which will massively reduce the amount of time you spend crafting a new email. Now, this isn't to say that all your outreach should come from the same template.</p><p class="">We all know that different prospects have different needs and styles and different approaches are necessary for each. But, if you can identify categories for whom certain email snippets are applicable, you can reduce the amount of re-inventing the wheel significantly, with a small amount of preparation. Here, an hour spent on prep will save you 100s of hours on writing throughout a year.</p><h3>2) Lead notification</h3><p class="">As business developers, we all know that timing is key. Most, if not all salespeople will have set a deal to Closed Lost with the note that 'it's not the right time' for a particular contact to buy. How much time would you save if you only spoke to people for whom your product was timed correctly?</p><p class="">If you've integrated your website analytics and your CRM and activated the appropriate notification systems, you will be able to see exactly who has visited your site when. This is one of the most underused tools in the marketing and sales toolkit which is bizarre because if you know that there's a prospect currently looking at your pricing page for the 3rd time today, it's probably a good time to pick up the phone because this lead is red-hot!</p><p class="">In other cases, it might not be quite as clear that a user is interested in making a purchase decision, but if they're looking at information pages about what you do and how you do it, there's an opportunity to provide them with even more tailored information that can help turn a fact-finding mission into a decision.</p><h3>3) Analytics and Reporting on Web and Email</h3><p class="">Targeted reporting, showing exactly what is working and what is not, how people are behaving on your site and emails, understanding what they are doing with your content and figuring out if this is helping a prospect to move forward is a great help in improving efficiency.</p><p class="">Even better if the reports are sent to the right internal stakeholders automatically, so each person receives customised information on the leads or clients for which they are responsible, without having to look for the information because it has been sent directly to their inbox.</p><p class="">This is doubly important because it provides information to those people who can actually take action on it. Typically website analytics are owned by the marketing team and they can't spend all their time forwarding interesting reports to the sales dept. But don't you think your account management team might benefit from knowing that their best customer just clicked on the next tier of your product offering?</p><h3>Don’t be dominated by technology</h3><p class="">But maybe you’re saying, “We have all that and I’m still overwhelmed.” in a very good <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/productivity-tips-for-salespeople-to-streamline-your-day-slideshare?__hstc=114228120.c10722a8da0dd6ae8615e83059199467.1548164976540.1577969374081.1577971909645.120&amp;__hssc=114228120.9.1577971909645&amp;__hsfp=2240718579"><span>HubSpot ‘5 minute read’</span></a>, author Doug Davidoff talks about the overwhelming amount of technical resource that can stop salespeople functioning efficiently as they search for the right system, process or report to enable them to take the next step.</p><p class="">If you are actually having to work harder because of the technology that’s supposed to be helping you then you may need a system that is more integrated and configurable for different roles.</p><p class="">Some marketing automation systems are over-complex requiring the attention of a programming team to make them work. Others are too simple and require add-on systems to provide a solution.</p><p class="">Other times, in the quest for efficiency and FOMO, can induce analysis paralysis as your Business Development teams work to figure out how they can use different tools and services to get a marginal edge.</p><p class="">We are HubSpot partners because we believe that HubSpot has got it right, not only in the technology they provide but in the philosophy that underpins it – inbound – an approach that covers all interactions with clients – marketing, sales and service.</p><h3>Inbound marketing&nbsp;</h3><p class="">There are two sides to this problem – one is not managing processes efficiently - especially on the sales side. As we have seen, tech can both help and get in the way.</p><p class="">The other side is this: “Are you too busy because you are going after prospects rather than letting prospects come to you?”</p><p class="">There is no question that chasing cold prospects is a numbers game, and the numbers are huge. It’s the modern-day equivalent of the sales reps who made 100 visits to get 10 business cards to get 1 meeting, and after weeks of mind-numbing slog, they made a sale.</p><p class="">In the process, they were bumped off by hundreds of potential buyers who were just not interested. Only the most determined and resilient managed, and one or two of them found the techniques to succeed in this drab milieu and became very successful.</p><h3>Talk to people who are already interested</h3><p class="">Life has moved a very long way. The biggest paradigm shift is that buyers now have the internet and can research information before they buy.</p><blockquote><p class="">__________________________________________________</p><p class=""><em>"47% of buyers viewed 3-5 pieces of content before engaging with a sales rep."</em> <em>Demand Gen Report, 2016 (Source: </em><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?__hstc=114228120.c10722a8da0dd6ae8615e83059199467.1548164976540.1577969374081.1577971909645.120&amp;__hssc=114228120.9.1577971909645&amp;__hsfp=2240718579"><span><em>https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics</em></span></a><em>)</em></p><p class=""><em>_________________________________________________</em></p></blockquote><p class="">That means that if you can get the right content in front of prospects at the right time, prospects will engage with you because they are already interested.</p><p class="">That’s so much easier than being rebuffed by hundreds of people who just don’t care. This is where marketers can really help.</p><p class=""><strong>How it works:</strong></p><h3>Knowledge is king:</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Research your customers and understand their pain-points</p></li><li><p class="">Recognise that they will research their problems as well as their solutions online</p></li><li><p class="">Know the journey your prospects are on from understanding their problem to deciding how to get to the right type of solution, to choosing a provider.</p></li></ul><h3>Use the 4 Bees:</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">BE HELPFUL. Provide what your prospect needs at every stage of their journey – whether it’s education, tools, templates, contacts…</p></li><li><p class="">Be honest – if you can’t help then still be helpful by suggesting alternative options</p></li><li><p class="">Be discoverable – learn how your prospects use the internet so they can find your help. Write plenty of relevant, helpful content – use blogs, videos, graphics – whatever is easiest for your prospect to consume</p></li><li><p class="">Be relevant – make sure your content actually provides the answers they have been searching for.</p></li></ul><h3>Help them engage:</h3><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Use carefully crafted offers and CTAs to invite them to your site</p></li><li><p class="">Build special landing pages – at least one per offer – maybe one per region or sales rep</p></li><li><p class="">Make sign up forms that are sufficient but not intrusive</p></li><li><p class="">Follow up quickly – don’t leave them hanging</p></li></ul><h3>Look after you</h3><p class="">This is absolutely common sense, but we all are guilty of forgetting ourselves when the pressure is on.</p><p class="">You are the go-to person for business development in your firm. That means people are relying on you, keeping you under pressure to deliver for the sale of everyone in the business.</p><p class="">So, as well as automating your activities in a smart way, and confining your outreach only to those who are already interested in your company’s products and services, you personally need to remain on top form too.</p><blockquote><p class="">__________________________________________________</p><p class=""><em>Check out the following life-hacks from HubSpot that focus on you and your well-being:</em></p><p class=""><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/morning-motivation-hacks?__hstc=114228120.c10722a8da0dd6ae8615e83059199467.1548164976540.1577969374081.1577971909645.120&amp;__hssc=114228120.9.1577971909645&amp;__hsfp=2240718579"><span><em>11 rituals to kickstart your morning</em></span></a></p><p class=""><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/the-key-to-productivity-is-your-body?__hstc=114228120.c10722a8da0dd6ae8615e83059199467.1548164976540.1577969374081.1577971909645.120&amp;__hssc=114228120.9.1577971909645&amp;__hsfp=2240718579"><span><em>The key to productivity isn’t your mind, it’s your body</em></span></a></p><p class=""><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/workplace-wellness?__hstc=114228120.c10722a8da0dd6ae8615e83059199467.1548164976540.1577969374081.1577971909645.120&amp;__hssc=114228120.9.1577971909645&amp;__hsfp=2240718579"><span><em>The ultimate guide to wellness at work</em></span></a></p><p class=""><a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/happiness-matters-at-work?__hstc=114228120.c10722a8da0dd6ae8615e83059199467.1548164976540.1577969374081.1577971909645.120&amp;__hssc=114228120.9.1577971909645&amp;__hsfp=2240718579"><span><em>Why emotional well-being matters at work</em></span></a></p><p class=""><em>__________________________________________________</em></p></blockquote><h3>Was this helpful?</h3><p class="">That’s probably enough for now – we don’t want to overwhelm you 😉.

That's true whether they found you organically, through an ad, from a referring site or through personal recommendation.</p><p class=""><em>And if you think about the array of choices and distractions they faced to get to you, it's amazing they ever did!</em></p><p class="">It's a bit like those heart-stopping documentaries you see of tiny newborn animals that have to make it to the sea or onto the ground through incredible odds, and loads of them don't make it, but enough do to ensure the species' survival.</p><h3>Understanding the continually changing customer</h3><p class="">If you follow customers back along their buying journey, you can see that before they were customers, they were just leads and before that, they were unknown prospects, and before that, they were not individuals at all but simply a set of demographic and psychographic attributes we call a target market.</p><p class=""><em>The amount of metamorphosis that customers undergo through their buying journey is incredible. It's hardly surprising most of them don't make it all the way.</em></p><p class="">Now let's take the journey forward from the point where they become customers. See how they continue to evolve and change even after they have signed up with you, and how that change is governed both by nurture and by nature.</p><h3>Nurture vs Nature</h3><p class="">Some are looked after so well that they transform from clients into delighted clients. These are the people who become repeat buyers and want to be up-sold and cross-sold so they can enhance their experience of your products, services and support.Delighted clients can turn into advocates - starting with simple reviews, then moving onto creating user-generated content and then becoming referrers of their trusted contacts, providing you with the best source of growth you can have. In the rarest examples of all, they can even become instrumental in designing your products or services. That's a huge journey from a demographic to a trusted partner.Others - probably the majority - simply stay as customers. They're happy enough, you've met their needs and as long as you continue to do that you won't hear too much from them.However, if we're honest one turned out to be wrong, for us and for them. No matter what we did, we couldn't meet their needs - they were a bad fit from the get-go, but how could we have known that?The answer, of course, is better research. This leads us to a really important question:</p><h3>How can we avoid the trap so many startups fall into?</h3><p class="">It's an unpalatable fact that by far the majority of firms, including FinTech firms fail within 5 years. Many have never had a single customer.Most failed FinTechs point to product development issues, lack of funding and competitive pressures. But those are consequences, not root causes.The root cause is actually a lack of research, and the most important research is into potential customers because if they don't want your solution, you cannot survive for long, even with generous investors.</p><h3>Solving our own problems</h3><p class="">Interestingly, one of the most common reason for a would-be entrepreneur to set up a FinTech company is to solve a problem they couldn’t solve when working for someone else. It’s an excellent reason to start your own company but no guarantee of success. Your problem may be unique or so heavily nuanced that it just doesn’t apply to the wider world.</p><h3>How to research prospective clients</h3><p class="">The entrepreneurial spirit often doesn’t have much room for the methodical details of research, but the FinTech graveyard speaks for itself. The ‘build-it-and-they’ll-come’ approach is a potentially lethal snakebite to all new businesses. Start by asking the right questions.</p><h3>What is my target market?</h3><p class="">It will probably be one you have some affinity with or one that you know well, but it doesn’t have to be. I know one marketer whose expertise was far away from her current area of practice, but she realised that she had something valuable to offer with her marketing skills to an industry that was very exciting and appealing to her but was very poor in understanding how to position and sell its products.</p><h3>What is the pain I see in this group?</h3><p class="">FinTech companies have to solve <em>something. </em>Otherwise, why not just leave it to the financial incumbents, who, for all their faults have all the experience, resources, skills to run the current financial markets.The most important thing you can do is identify the problem and assess if the problem is serious enough to be worth solving. If it’s not, then inertia will make life very difficult, especially if the solution you are thinking about is a more considered or complex purchase decision.If you already have customers, then talk to them, ask them what prompted them to buy your product.If you are planning a new product, desk research and take you some of the way, conferences will give you insights, and market research will take you yet further.Don’t be afraid to disqualify prospects if they are not a good fit. We are trying to get to the goal of delighted customers, and bad fits will damage your reputation, and you may well damage their business too. But by all means, tell them about better-fit providers – paying it forward like that can only be positive for you and them.</p><h3>Attracting prospects</h3><p class="">Many of the FinTech websites I see (and I’ve looked at hundreds) are glossy tributes to design and yet do nothing to help prospective clients.</p><h3>Make helpful sites</h3><p class="">Before you even think about setting out to attract people to your site, ask yourself this question, “Am I being helpful?” Is your site packed full of clear information that responds to the pain of your target audience? Are there opportunities for your prospects to engage with you from your site? Can they reach you to dive deeper into their problems?If FinTech firms thought of themselves more like medical doctors than sellers of the next great platform, they would organise their websites very differently. Those that do, have wonderful sites that are compelling and attractive to the suffering prospect!</p><h3>Write helpful content</h3><p class="">Remember that your prospect has a problem and their first recourse is Google.</p><p class=""><em>Fun Fact: Only 29% of people want to talk to a salesperson to learn more about a product, while 62% will consult a search engine. (</em><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics?__hstc=114228120.c10722a8da0dd6ae8615e83059199467.1548164976540.1577969374081.1577971909645.120&amp;__hssc=114228120.8.1577971909645&amp;__hsfp=2240718579" target="_blank"><span><em>HubSpot, 2016 </em></span></a><em>)</em></p><p class="">At this early stage they may be a long way from deciding on a solution. In fact, they may not even be able to articulate the problem, so their search terms will use the language of symptoms – probably quite long phrases trying to articulate the problem.</p><h3>Speak in the language of your patient...I mean prospect!</h3><p class="">Your job at this point is to provide the answer to the question, “What is this thing that ails me?” if you have the answer you're 30% of the way there. But your content still has to be discoverable. That means more research this time into keywords and search phrases so the content you provide will contain the phrases that your prospect is using to search for answers. How you use headings and sub-headings is also important – not just for readability, but also to help the web search engines properly index your content.</p><h3>Leave your content in the right place</h3><p class="">Then you have to write it. Lots of it in different forms; pictures, infographics, short blogs, videos, long reads. We all consume information differently.Did you know, for example, that including a video in a post increases organic traffic from search results by 157%? (Search Engine People, 2017) And you need to use the right channel, both digital and traditional according to the preferences of your prospect. Keep remembering, it’s all about being helpful.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p class="">At this point, you are the beginning of a journey with a target market that, because of you, understands its problems better and is poised to embark on a journey to develop a solution strategy.</p><p class="">There is much still to do to help your lead (no longer a prospect now they have found you and shown an interest in your company) through their journey to becoming a client and then an advocate, but this is already great progr</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f983681a3b29f646dbd85fe/1604397884012-9XPUQJITGNGEGJ6QW1DR/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="971"><media:title type="plain">Why FinTechs need to do more customer research</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Define your purpose to help position your FinTech firm</title><category>Positioning</category><category>Fintech</category><dc:creator>Jamie Dalton</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 10:57:16 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/blog/define-your-purpose-to-help-position-your-fintech-firm</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f983681a3b29f646dbd85fe:5f994a83a7b60175a5a43ffd:5f9bf146c5ccae00ef569556</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class=""><strong><em>Last week we wrote about the importance of positioning your firm properly.

Purpose creates a raft of qualities, benefits, characteristics than will benefit your business because of what you want to do for others.</p><p class="">The list below is just my take. If you want to comment, one great thing to do would be to explain your organisation’s purpose, and what it brings to you internally and externally. For us:</p><p class="">It creates passion and energy</p><p class="">It makes us distinctive</p><p class="">It makes our goals stable more quickly</p><p class="">It helps align our people</p><p class="">It helps attract like-minded recruitment candidates</p><p class="">It focuses our company on the right target market</p><p class="">It helps develop consistent messaging</p><p class="">In inbound marketing consistency and focus helps us become more discoverable</p><p class="">That will drive more relevant prospects to our business</p><p class="">Which will in turn, help our overall success</p><p class="">As we now have so many me-too, copycat, get-rich-quick start-ups, having a strongly articulated purpose will make you stand out and be noticed.</p><p class="">Our own purpose grew out of three things:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">One was the impact on society of banking exclusion. I have written <a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/blog/why-we-need-to-drive-banking-inclusivity">in an earlier blog about driving banking inclusivity</a> about the correlation between being unbanked and modern slavery. It’s an insight that really struck me and I wanted to try and help.</p></li><li><p class="">The second was, after 30 years in the financial services sector, I could see just how much the industry needed to change. Not only had banks lost their social purpose as TransferMate saw, they were also just hugely inefficient, and inefficiency had actually become part of the business model.</p></li><li><p class="">There is now a credible force within the tech start up sector that can constructively challenge the status quo, including through partnerships with the incumbents, to bring the customer voice back into the finance sector.</p></li></ul><h3>Building a uniting&nbsp;purpose</h3><p class="">It doesn't matter whether you are a start-up or a successful scale-up, having a clear purpose for your stakeholders to rally around, will improve your marketing, sales and client service and will set you apart from the masses.</p><p class="">Let's define three terms here - purpose, mission and strategy.</p><p class=""><strong>Purpose</strong> is very simply the reason why you exist - the single inspirational thing you do. For Disney it was to make people happy. It’s not something you can say is ever complete – it’s ongoing and doesn’t change even when the mission and strategy do.</p><p class="">Important: Your purpose is not to make profits - that may (or may not) be a result of your purpose but it is never the purpose itself.</p><p class=""><strong>Mission</strong> Describe the business you are in.</p><p class="">Think about the famous apocryphal story of US President Kennedy visiting NASA after his famous speech about putting a man on the moon and bringing him safely home again.</p><p class="">On his tour of the facility, he met a man who was a cleaner, but it couldn't have been obvious because the President asked him about his role. "Mr. President", the man replied, "I'm helping to put a man on the moon."</p><p class="">What he did was to clean the NASA facility so that the scientists could go about their work safely. But the real business he was in was to land a man on the moon – and his purpose – the one inspiring dream of a nation and a President, may even have been greater – to give human beings the ability to explore the universe.</p><p class="">It's interesting how inclusive purpose is; how it helps to rally people and unite them despite the diversity of their roles.</p><h3>Starting from why</h3><p class=""><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPYeCltXpxw"><span>Simon Sinek creato</span></a>r of the Golden Circle and author of "Start with Why", says that everyone knows what they do, and some people know how they do it, but few people know why.</p><p class="">When you can answer 'why' the 'how' and 'what' fall into place much more easily.</p><p class=""><strong>Here are some starter questions to get you thinking:</strong></p><p class=""><em>What problem do you exist to solve?</em></p><p class=""><em>If you could not possibly fail, what would you like to achieve with your business?</em></p><p class=""><em>What lasting contribution do you want to leave?</em></p><p class=""><em>If your firm ceased to exist tonight, what would happen / not happen?</em></p><h3>Using your purpose to position your FinTech</h3><p class="">Once you have your purpose you have the springboard for so many things.</p><p class="">Internally it can help set the culture of your firm and it can drive your recruitment strategy (where you look, what values you look for...)</p><p class="">Externally it is an important factor in helping to position your agency, and this determines how you differentiate your firm and gives you a laser-beam focus on reaching your objectives. The trick to reaching objectives is to have a clear understanding of your purpose and using it to drive other aspects of your marketing activities such as <a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/s/Flagship-Marketing-Guide-to-Generating-Inbound-Leads.pdf" target="_blank">lead generation and inbound strategies</a>. From this position, creating customers from users is made significantly easier because there's a vision underpinning the sales strategy.</p><p class=""><strong>It works for existing firms as well as start-ups.</strong></p><p class="">Start-ups have a clean canvas on which to paint their ideal picture, but existing firms have some strong advantages.</p><p class=""><strong>You know your current position</strong></p><p class="">Most scale-ups have a business plan, and a clear idea of the problems they are solving for and their target markets (the who). They also know if the way they communicate their positioning is resonating with their targets or if there is more work to do.</p><p class=""><strong>You are gaining an understanding of your market</strong></p><p class="">Scale-ups will also already know the type of companies with which they have had success, and those that perhaps they though would be good prospects, but for some reason are not biting.</p><p class=""><strong>You know what you are and are not! (The what)</strong></p><p class="">Many firms go into business thinking they are one thing, e.g. payments experts and actually find out that their most valuable skill is something different - e.g. developing apps for white-labelling.</p><p class="">I know it sounds strange, but you would be surprised how long it takes for many organisations to find their metier.</p><p class="">Knowing what you are and what you are not is a signal that you are listening to your market and have adapted to its demands.</p><p class=""><strong>Culture</strong></p><p class="">You have a culture simply by working together, but it may not be the culture you want, and it may not be very unified and aligned. Your purpose is the banner around which to create a single strong culture with like-minded people to support it.</p><p class=""><strong>Positioning</strong></p><p class="">Putting all this together can help you develop a powerful positioning statement that describes what you do, for who, how you do it, and most importantly, WHY you do it.</p>]]></description><media:content type="image/jpeg" url="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f983681a3b29f646dbd85fe/1604397844388-M42LJVSS6AQE4CVS9M68/image-asset.jpeg?format=1500w" medium="image" isDefault="true" width="1500" height="994"><media:title type="plain">Define your purpose to help position your FinTech firm</media:title></media:content></item><item><title>Why should your prospect buy from you? - Positioning in FinTech</title><category>Positioning</category><category>Fintech</category><dc:creator>Jamie Dalton</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 10:56:01 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/blog/why-should-your-prospect-buy-from-you-positioning-in-fintech</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f983681a3b29f646dbd85fe:5f994a83a7b60175a5a43ffd:5f9bf0cb2d9e614d930754c9</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="">Why should your customers buy from you and not your competitors?</p><p class=""><strong>Ask the question, "Who did you create your FinTech for?" and you are likely to get an answer along the lines of "those people who are fed up paying exorbitant forex fees and want a better solution."</strong></p><p class="">This tells us something about the purpose of the firm, what it does and who it does it for. In other words, it starts to position the firm.</p><p class="">There's a lot of fluff written about positioning but it's actually very practical and pragmatic. We can define positioning as the process to put a product or a service into a particular niche in the minds of potential consumers.</p><p class="">There are two big factors here:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">a position has to be relative to something else and in marketing that is your competitors.</p></li><li><p class="">The second factor is an emotional one - how do your potential customer perceive your product? Utilitarian, commonplace, cheap, essential, luxurious, exclusive, nice-to-have?</p></li></ul><h3>Why you should do more to position your firm accurately</h3><p class="">Lots of FinTechs start with a problem in mind - maybe something the founder has encountered or seen in a previous job, for which she thinks a useful solution could be found.</p><p class="">If that's as far as your positioning goes you are not alone, but if you are daunted by the competition and want to stand out, you'll need to do more.</p><h3>Why should your client buy from you - not from the others?</h3><p class="">At the heart of positioning is understanding your prospects' pain points and challenges. When you say you want to help people who are fed up with paying exorbitant fees for forex payments are you sure that's the real need?</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Is it fees?</p></li><li><p class="">or is the time it takes to complete a transfer?</p></li><li><p class="">or is it the complexity of the process you have to go through?</p></li><li><p class="">or is it reliability of providers' portals?</p></li><li><p class="">or is it insufficient geographical coverage?</p></li><li><p class="">or is it the difficulty of reaching unbanked constituents?</p></li></ul><p class="">Can you solve for all of them or only for one?</p><h3>How big is your problem?</h3><p class="">Is the fees problem the best for you in terms of the market size? What about some of the others? Can you combine them? After all, just cutting fees sounds like a hard way to compete against the incumbent banks who hold all the cards when it comes to existing customers, brand awareness, financial reserves and the like.</p><p class="">It is critical to research the problem and know what you are solving for. Go deeper than your initial thinking to uncover the real problem that is worth investing in.</p><h3>How&nbsp;competitive is your landscape</h3><p class="">When I was studying at IDM we heard a lot about Blue Ocean strategies. That's a reference to a book by Chan, R. Mauborgne &amp; K. Mauborgne which encouraged organisations to look for a place where there was little competition (the blue ocean) and design a product to sit in that niche.</p><p class="">It's great if you can find such a big clear space in which to operate but even if you can't you have to differentiate your organisations from your competition in the mind of your customer.</p><p class="">Remember car rental firm Avis who languished in the number 2 spot behind Hertz? They made a virtue of their situation through a wonderful ad campaign and tag line 'We try harder'.</p><p class="">How are you going to differentiate your organisation from those around you? By focusing deeply on the aspects that make your firm unique.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">Your skills and experience in a particular sector - you are not generic but a specialist in something</p></li><li><p class="">Perhaps it's the culture of your organisation - a passionate belief in banking inclusion and global trade for the benefit of poorer economies</p></li></ul><h3>How well do you know your prospect?</h3><p class="">If you're marketing to a firm, who in the firm has the problem you are solving for? What are the implications of that problem, what does your prospect have to do to work around the issue? How severely does he feel the pain?</p><p class="">What does the person do about the problem? Very often they Google to understand more about the issue and how to resolve it. You need to know right at the beginning of that search journey</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">how they use Google to search for answers</p></li><li><p class="">what search terms they use</p></li><li><p class="">where they consume information</p></li><li><p class="">when they tend to look and more...</p></li></ul><p class="">This is where you start to build up personas - fictionalised descriptions of your prospects that will help you to understand them better and position your products and services accordingly.</p><h3>We've come a long way</h3><p class="">Once we have done all this, we will have come a long way from the original problem statement, "helping people who are fed up paying exorbitant forex fees and want a better solution." We'll know exactly what the problem is, how big it is, who is experiencing it, what the competitive landscape looks like and how our solution is different. That's the level of focus that brings success.</p><p class="">Positioning your company accurately is the key to finding your unique location, it will help determine how you price your product, how you communicate about it, the channels you use and even the product or service itself.</p><p class="">In fact, by doing this exercise, you will consider all of the original 4Ps of marketing; product, price promotion and place - and more.</p><h3>What's next?</h3><p class="">From here you can easily build out your value proposition if you'd like to. This is the broad benefit statement that will be used to give consistency to all your messaging. Marketing orthodoxy says that's the right thing to do, but I believe, if you have done this exercise well, you have plenty here on which to base consistent and powerful messaging.</p><p class="">The question is, what do you want to do next? What are your goals?

Visiting the start-up stands, dashing from meeting to meeting and fitting in the challenging talks, was inspiring, uplifting and energising.</p><p class="">Conferences where there are lots of start-ups are great because you get to see the people behind the brand.</p><p class="">So, just for fun, here are my top meets – the firms that caught my eye.</p><h3>KontainersUK</h3><p class="">These guys are on a mission to transform the shipping world, and it sounds like it needs to happen. Apparently, it takes 60 emails and 20 phone calls to deliver a container by sea. Now all you have to do is to type your details onto their website (kontainers.com) accept the quote and you’re good to go.</p><p class="">KontainersUK won the start-up pitch competition at the Dublin Tech Summit 2018 against stiff opposition and I look forward to seeing if they can really do what they say they’re going to do and transform freight shipping for good!</p><h3>AssureHedge</h3><p class="">I met Margaret from Assure Hedge who explained their new system and value proposition. If a value proposition is so simple that it just makes sense the moment you hear it, you know it's good.</p><p class="">Assure Hedge’s is to give SMEs access to currency hedging previously only available to multinationals. That’s it – so straightforward, distinctive, with a clear target market and a need that others aren’t meeting. Love it!</p><p class="">We live in a world of global trade, despite the protectionist rhetoric of which we’re hearing far too much at the moment. Just like Kontainers are taking care of the physical side of global trade, so Assure Hedge is taking care of the financial and risk side, because the banks simply can’t supply quotes for smaller firms or smaller exposures.</p><p class="">Putting the client back at the centre of banking services is why we have a FinTech movement and Assure Hedge are doing just that. Crucially, they have just come through the excellent FCA regulatory sandbox programme, and have emerged as a regulated entity, and are ready to start making a difference!</p><h3>TransferMate</h3><p class="">Transfer Mate are hardly a start-up now. With a presence in 9 countries and more than 6,000 clients, they’re better described as a force to be reckoned with.</p><p class="">Tracy gave us a wonderful welcome at the stand with some much-needed coffee. (Interestingly, the only stand I visited with a coffee machine – no wonder they’re successful; these guys know their target market!)</p><p class="">If you don’t know them already and you need a B2B cross-border payments platform with wide coverage and lots of bells and whistles, TransferMate could become a trusted partner for you, as they have become for so many others from accountants to football clubs.</p><p class="">By the way, have you noticed how many of my standout firms are trying to facilitate global business? I find that very encouraging.</p><h3>Fintech Jobs</h3><p class="">Ian met David Crowley, expecting to speak about supply chain finance and ended up talking about a unique job board for fintechs – and he came back full of enthusiasm for the idea.</p><p class="">David and his partner Gerry have set up Fintech Jobs Dublin, and good for them because it’s strange, but there seem to be very few dedicated fintech job boards. I found one in Australia and a couple in SE Asia, which makes sense, but not many.</p><p class="">I think it’s a nice idea; David and Gerry have picked up on it before many others and they have lots of experience in financial services and recruitment, so they deserve to make this fly. Look out for them when you next need a job!</p><p class="">So that’s my hits, but I can’t leave without mentioning a few more who were really great.</p><p class="">Somehow, I found myself in the background of an interview that Timmu from Wolf3D was giving on the Iconic Co-working stand and heard a little from the man himself about his passion for 3D avatars. Using the Wolf3D system, you can scan yourself, and play as yourself in online games and be yourself in VR and AR communications. Neat!</p><p class="">I saw DesignWizard running a great application for designing everything from logos to Birthday Cards and brochures. I was very impressed with Pluralsight’s enormous range of learning experiences for the techie, wannabe techie and especially the frustrated human resources department who really don’t know what their teams can do.</p><p class="">And thanks to my daughter Sarah, I had a constant update from the music-tech stream, which sounded very exciting – a good time to be in the music business by all accounts.</p><p class="">Lastly a big thank you to Iconic for a spot to sit, meet people and re-charge in both senses!</p><p class="">Thank you too, Dublin Tech Summit, 18. I’m looking forward to seeing even more new things again next year.</p><p class=""><br></p><p class=""><strong>* We’re not giving you investment advice – please read this – it is important</strong></p><p class=""><em>Flagship Marketing® is a marketing agency.

But if the collaboration doesn’t work out, the banks lose money and credibility, the fintechs lose everything, and the industry simply plods on making incremental changes.</p><p class="">And what about the consumer? Well, it depends.</p><h3>Challenger solutions have their place, but more complex situations demand collaboration</h3><p class="">Challenger solutions mean some products like forex transactions are already cheaper than the incumbents provide, so the consumer wins, but the breakdown in correspondent banking relationships in Africa, an unintended consequence of new banking regulation, is a much more complex story.</p><p class="">In brief, tougher KYC/AML (and other) regulations introduced following the global financial crisis, have raised the cost of compliance directly and by imposing higher reserve capital requirements. The impact of this is that banks need to be more selective about the business they pursue, and this has given rise to a reduction of correspondent banking relationships in emerging economies in Africa, the Caribbean, and APAC.</p><p class="">As far back as 2015, <a href="https://oi-files-d8-prod.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/file_attachments/rr-bank-de-risking-181115-en_0.pdf">Oxfam</a> was flagging concerns. “The closure of correspondent banking accounts presents a tangible threat to international trade finance, particularly for the developing world”.</p><p class="">And in late 2016 <a href="https://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/3dc1cc57-2ab3-4eab-8018-f93203d5a00b/EMCompass+Note+24+De-risking+and+Trade+Finance+11-15+FINAL.pdf?MOD=AJPERES"><span>a report by the IFC</span></a>, (part of the World Bank group) noted, “The emergence of new technologies from the private sector has significant potential to contribute to a reduction in compliance costs and an increase in risk assessment precision.”</p><p class="">Here we see the need for global regulation, banking incumbents and new technology to come together with a clear economic and social purpose. A challenger on its own can’t make it happen. Collaboration is key.</p><h3>“Learn to work better together” – that’s just too easy</h3><p class="">But how to make it happen? It’s far too easy to say that banks need to collaborate better. As we have already seen, they face a wall of regulation stemming from the same crisis that gave birth to the fintech movement.</p><p class="">That automatically means a slower and more complex process than an unregulated fintech working alone would face. Because organisations are regulated, not platforms or tech solutions, an unregulated fintech company can sometimes* operate solutions that would be more difficult, costly or require more governance to be operated from within a regulated entity, <em>(*of course depending on the activity, some fintechs are regulated too.)</em></p><h3>Fragile legacy tech – proceed with caution</h3><p class="">Another issue is technology. Banks run on mainframes as much as they do on distributed network. Millions of lines of code have been developed over perhaps a forty-year period. Some is changed regularly, some is never touched. The programs are written to different standards, some outsourced, some off-shored, some developed onshore.</p><p class="">Above all, much of it is integrated, meaning changes in one area can have unanticipated consequences in other parts of the business. That’s why, despite massive IT budgets and ambitious development programs, banks are incredibly cautious and careful when developing, especially their core systems. And roadmaps are typically more congested than the motorways on a bank holiday.</p><p class="">Having said that, for the fintech firm, even one which understands and appreciates the problem, time to market in an increasingly competitive market, can be an existential threat.</p><h3>How can collaboration work in such different cultures?</h3><p class="">Reducing the complexity of collaboration to a few points is likely to leave more questions than answers, but I hope it will trigger essential thinking for those contemplating a commercial relationship.</p><p class="">1. Of course, the first point is to choose your partner carefully.</p><p class="">2. You must sense the politics – where is the support for such a deal, how strong is the opposition (if any) where are the obvious win/wins, how much respect is there for what you are bringing to the table, how closely are goals aligned? How will you and they manage the entire community of interests?</p><p class="">3. You must also understand the competence. Managing for a shared result where the parties are operating in very different ways and standards requires excellent management skills, creativity, imagination, communication and so on.</p><p class="">4. At a tactical level, how will decision-making take place? Is it hierarchical, can there be some acceptance of decentralised decision making – is that the goal of the incumbent (and the fintech?) Is consensus required (that will really slow things down).</p><p class="">5. As within any deal there is a need to build understanding in both parties, exchange ideas, agree on what winning looks like.</p><p class="">6. For a fintech to retain its agility, there needs to be a loose grip on the reigns, and a good clear mechanism for resolving issues and getting decisions made.</p><p class="">7. Obviously, as this is a partnership, there will be collaboration. Where is work shared and where is it divided? Is it just a question of funding, or is there a cross-pollination of ideas, experience, and even actual work?</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p class="">It’s important not to confuse trends and realities.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">There is clearly a move away from start-up funding to more established firms, but there is still plenty of money available for the right start-up. There is a tendency for more copycat firms doing similar things, and they will struggle, but that doesn’t mean all fintech start-ups are like that or that innovation has suddenly disappeared. And, in the same way, there is a trend towards collaboration, but there is still a real place for challenger firms too, and they are transforming the industry for good.</p></li><li><p class="">Serial acquirer enterprises map the cultures of the firms they are acquiring onto their own culture maps to create an environment where the new acquisition can be most effective. But in our world, there is too little attention paid to the way that collaboration will work and much more paid to the final product.</p></li><li><p class="">In this relationship, it may seem that the banks have all the aces, but that’s not the case. Getting it wrong is unlikely to seriously damage a global bank, but it could spell disaster for a young fintech company. If collaboration is to be the way forward, both parties have a responsibility to think it through in every respect, so that it works.</p></li></ul><p class=""><em>Flagship Marketing Limited ® is a marketing agency helping fintech companies grow their businesses.

The entrepreneur is Elizabeth Holmes and her company is Theranos, a firm that enticed investors to the tune of $700 million over claims that its new technologies would transform the blood testing industry.</p><h3>Where did Theranos cross the line?</h3><p class="">The truth was, the technology didn’t work, or at least didn’t work well enough. Somewhere, Holmes crossed a line when pitching to investors. Did she lie? Not entirely, she had a system called Edison which could analyse blood samples, but we are now learning that it couldn’t do everything as well as she claimed.</p><p class="">Was it then an exaggeration? Clearly it wasn’t just a bit of sales spin, or she wouldn’t be facing a negotiated settlement of $500,000 plus 19 million shares in her company, ending control of her own empire. The SEC have called it “a massive fraud”.</p><p class="">But she wasn’t just seeking to trouser the loot and run either. She set up a real business and employed hundreds of people; the Food and Drug Administration approved one of her products; she partnered with giant multinationals.</p><p class="">The truth seems to be that she had a great idea, tested it and ran with it for years before seeking funding, but as we see from the SEC quote, she claimed that the funding was to support a product that could <em>already </em>do the things she described in her pitch, rather than admitting that the product was not there yet, and that funding would be needed to develop it further. That’s called misleading your investors and it’s a bad place to be.</p><h3>Lessons for fintech</h3><p class="">What can we learn from this in the fintech industry? We have already noted how more<a href="https://www.flagshipmarketing.com/blog/the-fintech-movement-changes-in-a-maturing-market"> funding is being targeted at established fintechs rather than new start-ups</a>, and how the fintech bubble is attracting more and more copycat firms.</p><p class="">Increasing competition means there is a need for fintechs to get their message out, to sell harder, but never at the risk of crossing a line and of misleading investors. I’m not suggesting for a moment that the risk will lead to the consequences faced by Theranos. That was fraud on a rare scale. But the pertinent point is that anything less than scrupulous honesty and transparency with investors, will damage your reputation and your prospects.</p><h3>But doesn’t everyone do it a bit?</h3><p class="">I doubt it, and what if they do? Despite the Theranos story, investors are good at due diligence so don't take a chance. Depending on how investors see the risk of investing, the terms of their funding may be different, but once on board they will know exactly what the situation is and can support accordingly. Remember, if any investor believes in you enough to provide funding, they have skin in the game, a vested interest in your success. And even if they don't take you on, that's disappointing, but it's also incredible feedback that could save you a great deal of money and stress.</p><h3>Get the basics right – it works</h3><p class="">To set up any investor relationship, we must go back to first principles – Value Proposition and Business Model. Who are your customers? What is your unique (<em>not</em> copycat) value to each of your target segments? How can you deliver it? What will it cost?</p><p class="">If you have a Value Proposition that is truly distinctive, that is relevant to customer groups that you have researched and understood, and a Business Model that is robust and credible, there’s no need to exaggerate, even a little. And that’s a good thing, because your reputation as a scrupulously honest business is far too important to risk.</p><p class=""><em>Flagship Marketing Limited ® is a marketing agency helping fintech companies grow their businesses.

He said something which made me question our industry.</em></p><h3>“The poor have no access to justice”</h3><p class="">That’s the simple statement I heard this morning which really struck home. And the question it raised for me was, <em>“Does the absence of banks in poor areas contribute to the modern slave trade?”</em></p><p class="">Here are two scenarios, one macro and one micro:</p><p class="">The first is a country that cannot support its workers – either through famine or war or corruption. Countries who cannot support a population (or parts of a population) create a vision that the world must be better elsewhere – migration. Migrants are incredibly vulnerable – in fact they are a major supply chain to the slave industry. It’s been well documented that you can buy a migrant slave in an open slave market in Libya for USD 400.</p><p class="">The second is a rural village. A man falls ill, and his family need to borrow. There is no bank, so they go to the local moneylender. The trap is sprung there and then, a USD 20 loan that can never be repaid. The family is indentured to work to repay the money – but because they are given some food and a mat to sleep on, the bill keeps getting bigger.</p><p class="">My friend from IJM said they recently rescued somebody from bonded labour for the equivalent of a USD 15 loan. But it wasn’t his loan, it was his grandfather’s. He was the 3rd generation working to pay off this tiny debt.</p><h3>Banking inclusivity at all levels is key</h3><p class="">Yes, this is a huge problem viewed through a single lens. According to IJM, the slavery business is worth USD 150 bn a year. But complex or not, banks, microfinance organisations and FinTechs are part of the solution.</p><p class="">It’s true that this is an area where post-crisis regulation hasn’t helped. New rules mean banks must choose the risks they take on (so-called de-risking) and trade and supply-chain finance in developing economies are not top of the list. But if we don’t support business in these economies, we will see more economic migration than ever before.</p><p class="">And at the micro level, if we don’t do more in rural and urban communities to provide safe lending, the bonded labour model will grow too.</p><h3>How many slaves work for you?</h3><p class="">Apparently, with the leather in our shoes, the rare elements in our phones, cotton shirts and so on, someone has estimated that in western Europe we each own the output of about 60 slaves, (I took a survey that said I have 74 slaves working for me.)</p><p class="">Frankly I don’t want any slaves in my life, do you? We need to drive financial inclusivity and that’s why I am hopeful that real social change will come about because of the crisis, perhaps through the challenge that many (not all) FinTech companies and other firms are making to the social status quo.</p><p class=""><em>Flagship Marketing Limited ® is a marketing agency helping fintech companies grow their businesses.

There is still finance available for start-ups, but there are now more established fintech firms and the trend suggests that more investors are looking there for their returns.</p><p class=""><strong>Change:</strong> Investor patterns are changing – the market is maturing.</p><p class=""><strong>Question:</strong> Will start-ups still receive funding?</p><p class=""><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, but it’s getting harder. They must be able to demonstrate that they are meeting a real need in a viable market, that their business plan is solid, and their value proposition is credible and distinctive.</p><h3>Build it and they’ll come…err…not anymore!&nbsp;</h3><p class="">Our own research looking at start-ups show that there are far too many young firms, building the same type of technology, (mainly apps) to achieve similar goals. With no distinctive value proposition, investors cannot be expected to understand where to invest. It’s a popular fiction that most business fail in their first year – they hang on for a bit longer than that – but according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the US about 50% fail within the first five years. But where there’s a bandwagon, with lots of imitator firms, the number of failures will be higher.</p><p class=""><strong>Change:</strong> Fintechs are becoming more homogenous and, in some cases, indistinguishable from one another. Creative start-ups need to stand out in an ocean of copycat firms, and as investors start looking at more established firms, they need to work hard to get their unique message across. New fintechs need, above all, to avoid copying others and develop a clear and relevant advantage that they can articulate, position and sell!</p><h3>Will fintech firms become the thing they wanted to challenge?&nbsp;</h3><p class="">Everyone knows that the fintech movement grew from the ashes of the global financial crisis. Three things characterised the early movement: the use of emerging technologies – robotics, AI, machine learning, big data, blockchain; the ability to provide customer value through agile, relevant, low cost solutions, and an understanding of the financial industry’s social responsibility, especially the need to put the customer first, that had long eluded the profit-at-all-costs incumbents.</p><p class="">Another excellent study, The World Fintech Report 2018 by Capgemini collaborating with EFMA suggests that “the relationship between FinTechs and traditional financial institutions has morphed from competition to collaboration”.</p><p class="">We have been involved in several cases where financial incumbents have taken on fintech firms. The challenges often lie in the differences in culture between the highly regulated, highly organised incumbents, and the fast-moving start-ups, but in successful collaborations, both parties find a way to understand and work across the cultural divide. According to the Capgemini report, we should expect to see more and more of this type of collaboration.</p><p class="">I remember sitting in a conference where the organisers ranged a group of banks at one end of the room, facing a group of fintechs at the other end, and simply let them battle it out.</p><p class="">Today is different because of the progress made by the fintech market in challenging the financial incumbents to behave in a different way.</p><p class="">It isn’t done yet, bank charges are still too high, new regulations are still forcing banks away from fulfilling their social obligations, and there is a risk that economic recovery wipe away some of the lessons of the recent past. That’s why there is still a real need for great challenger fintechs, and why we should continue to support their drive to transform the industry.</p><p class="">But in other cases, change has been sufficient to allow fintechs to work with the banks rather than trying to destroy them, and that’s positive too, as it signals that banks are making steps in the right direction, even if it has come about mainly through fear of the fintech movement!</p><p class=""><strong>Change:</strong> Fintechs are not just looking to challenge the status quo. There are opportunities to transform the industry through collaboration too. We believe that this is the time for both approaches, but any fintech looking to collaborate should consider seriously the culture differences between themselves and their investor bank, and how this might affect their goals.</p><p class="">Flagship Marketing Limited ® is a marketing agency helping fintech companies grow their businesses.

Focus and relevance are vital in what we do say, and these come by deepening our knowledge and understanding.</p><h3>The key is knowing more, not saying more</h3><p class="">We live in a world where we are convinced that B2B sales must be more complex than B2C sales, and there are good reasons for that:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="">There’s often more at stake for a buyer making a corporate purchase than making one for home.</p></li><li><p class="">Often the things we buy for work are more complex (in scale or scope) than the things we buy for our homes.</p></li><li><p class="">More people tend to get involved in work buying decisions than they do at home, including professional buying departments.</p></li><li><p class="">Business purchases maybe multi-site or even multinational.</p></li><li><p class="">There are often extraneous factors, such compatibility up and down supply chains, or reciprocity deals.</p></li></ul><p class="">Some B2B marketers produce incredible campaigns that hit the target time after time, but if we don’t understand our clients we will use too many:</p><p class="">· different channels because it’s not clear where clients consume information;</p><p class="">· marketing messages because the real needs of the prospects are not clear.</p><p class="">If there’s not enough information to say something relevant and focused, swamping the channels with noise, hoping something resonates with an important prospect, is a common approach. But it’s more likely to cause anger and frustration.</p><h3>A blunderbuss to catch a butterfly</h3><p class="">Spamming prospects is like using a blunderbuss to catch a butterfly. If you use a blunderbuss to catch a beautiful butterfly, it’s not surprising that disaster ensues, and it may be illegal.</p><p class="">For B2B marketers, disaster means the overwhelming noise that Spenner and Freeman talk about in their HBR article – pushing clients away rather than drawing them in. It’s the unhelpful intrusion into their busy professional lives; a lack of respect that makes marketing a drag on business growth, rather than a boost.</p><h3>The answer is to use your data (and other people’s)</h3><p class="">All those proverbs, “Still waters run deep”, “Think before you speak”, “Look before you leap” point to the same thing – communication without understanding is full of risk. The key to de-risking marketing, is data.</p><p class="">Businesses are stuffed full of data (held in a fully compliant manner of course!) Sales has it, relationship management has it, finance has it, the web team has it, product has it, traders have it, policy wonks have it, lobbyists have it– often all mixed up, duplicated, out of date and a bit massaged, so maybe not quite compliant yet, but it’s there.</p><p class="">But it still needs to be used – cleaned up, de-duped, updated, and then researched, thought about, segmented, profiled, modelled and overlaid with industry and sector insights, and statistics from external organisations and fed back as a clear vision of our clients and prospects.</p><p class="">It’s data that fuels thought; powers analysis, and ultimately creates understanding. And when you really understand, you can put away the blunderbuss, walk up to the plant where you know your butterfly sits, and with a drop of honey, coax it into your hands.</p><p class="">* * *</p><p class=""><em>Flagship Marketing is a B2B agency that wants to help firms develop their business over the long term, fairly, respectfully and effectively.
